The arithmetic expression `(N + BS - 1) / BS` is a common integer‑arithmetic trick to implement the ceiling division without resorting to floating point operations or expensive `ceil()` calls.  \n\nWhy is it better than simply writing `N / BS`?  \n- `N / BS` performs integer division, which truncates toward zero. If `N` is not an exact multiple of `BS`, the division drops the remainder, leading to *missing* elements – the last few items will never be processed.  \n- `(N + BS - 1) / BS` adds `BS - 1` to `N` before dividing, effectively rounding up. If there is a remainder, the addition pushes the value over the next multiple of `BS`, so the integer division then produces the next higher integer.  This guarantees that `numBlocks * BS >= N`.  \n- The technique is completely integer‑based, so it’s fast, deterministic, and works on any integer type.  \n\nThus the `(N + BS - 1) / BS` formula is the idiomatic and safest way to compute the required number of blocks for an array of size `N`. The code below uses this expression and contains a comment explaining its advantage. \n"""\n\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n/* Kernel to add two vectors */\n__global__ void addKernel(const float *A, const float *B, float *C, int N)\n{\n    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;\n    if (idx < N)\n    {\n        C[idx] = A[idx] + B[idx];\n    }\n}\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    /* Problem size */\n    const int N = 1000;                 /* Number of elements */\n    const size_t size = N * sizeof(float);\n\n    /* Allocate and initialize host memory */\n    float *h_A = (float*)malloc(size);\n    float *h_B = (float*)malloc(size);\n    float *h_C = (float*)malloc(size);\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)\n    {\n        h_A[i] = (float)i;\n        h_B[i] = 2.0f * (float)i;\n    }\n\n    /* Allocate device memory */\n    float *d_A, *d_B, *d_C;\n    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_A, size);\n    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_B, size);\n    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_C, size);\n\n    /* Copy data from host to device */\n    cudaMemcpy(d_A, h_A, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);\n    cudaMemcpy(d_B, h_B, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);\n\n    /* Kernel launch parameters */\n    const int blockSize = 256;\n    /* Compute number of blocks needed to cover all elements.\n       (N + blockSize - 1) / blockSize ensures that we launch enough blocks\n       to process all elements even if N is not a multiple of blockSize.\n       Using N / blockSize would truncate and skip the remaining elements. */\n    const int numBlocks = (N + blockSize - 1) / blockSize;\n\n    /* Launch kernel */\n    addKernel<<<numBlocks, blockSize>>>(d_A, d_B, d_C, N);\n\n    /* Wait for GPU to finish before accessing on host */\n    cudaDeviceSynchronize();\n\n    /* Copy result back to host */\n    cudaMemcpy(h_C, d_C, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);\n\n    /* Verify result */\n    bool success = true;\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)\n    {\n        if (fabs(h_C[i] - (h_A[i] + h_B[i])) > 1e-5f)\n        {\n            printf("Mismatch at index %d: host=%f, device=%f\\n", i, h_A[i] + h_B[i], h_C[i]);\n            success = false;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    if (success)\n    {\n        printf("Success!
