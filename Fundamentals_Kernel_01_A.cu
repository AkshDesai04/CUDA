/*
Aim of the program:
Modify the program to launch the kernel with two blocks, each with one thread.

Thinking:
The task requires a CUDA C program that demonstrates how to configure a kernel launch
with exactly two blocks and one thread per block. To keep the example minimal yet
illustrative, a simple device kernel that prints its block and thread indices using
`printf` is used. This showcases that the kernel indeed runs with the requested
configuration. The host code performs a single kernel launch with the launch
configuration `<<<2, 1>>>` (two blocks, one thread each). After the launch we call
`cudaDeviceSynchronize()` to ensure that the kernel completes before the program
terminates, which is necessary when using device `printf`. No additional memory
allocation or complex logic is needed for this demonstration. The program is fully
selfâ€‘contained and can be compiled with `nvcc` to produce an executable that prints
the expected output when run.
