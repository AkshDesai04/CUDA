In your main function, attempt to compile this file using the NVIDIA CUDA Compiler (NVCC) command line, for example: nvcc my_program.cu -o my_program. Run the resulting executable.`\n\n""" \nTo satisfy the user request we need a minimal CUDA program that defines an empty kernel and calls it from `main`. \nThe kernel will be called with a single thread block of one thread, performing no operations. \nAfter the launch we will synchronize the device to ensure the kernel has finished before the host program exits, \nand we will print a simple message so the user can see that the executable ran successfully. \nThe program will compile with `nvcc my_program.cu -o my_program` and run with `./my_program`. \nNo external libraries are required other than the CUDA runtime. \n"""\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n__global__ void dummyKernel()\n{\n    // This kernel intentionally does nothing.\n}\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // Launch the kernel with a single thread block of one thread.\n    dummyKernel<<<1, 1>>>();\n\n    // Wait for the kernel to finish.\n    cudaError_t err = cudaDeviceSynchronize();\n    if (err != cudaSuccess)\n    {\n        fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error after kernel launch: %s\\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    printf("Dummy kernel executed successfully.\\n");\n    return 0;\n}\n', images=None, tool_calls=None)
