Write a minimal CUDA program with a simple kernel that writes a value to an array.  \n2. Allocate device memory, launch the kernel, then call cudaDeviceSynchronize() to wait for the kernel to finish and to flush any pending operations.  \n3. Call cudaDeviceReset() to reset the device.  \n4. Include error checking after each CUDA call.  \n5. Add comments inside the code that explain that synchronizing before resetting ensures that all queued work has completed, that any errors are captured before the context is destroyed, and that it is helpful for debugging and profiling.  \n\nThe program will be self‑contained and compile with `nvcc`. It will print messages to illustrate the sequence and the reasoning.  \n"""\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n// Simple kernel that writes a value to an array\n__global__ void fillKernel(int *d_arr, int val, int n)\n{\n    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;\n    if (idx < n)\n        d_arr[idx] = val;\n}\n\n// Helper macro for CUDA error checking\n#define CUDA_CHECK(call)                                                      \\\n    do {                                                                      \\\n        cudaError_t err = (call);                                             \\\n        if (err != cudaSuccess) {                                             \\\n            fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error in %s (%s:%d): %s\\n",                 \\\n                    #call, __FILE__, __LINE__, cudaGetErrorString(err));     \\\n            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);                                               \\\n        }                                                                     \\\n    } while (0)\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    const int N = 256;\n    const int val = 42;\n\n    int *d_arr = NULL;\n    size_t size = N * sizeof(int);\n\n    // Allocate device memory\n    CUDA_CHECK(cudaMalloc((void **)&d_arr, size));\n    printf("Allocated device memory.\\n");\n\n    // Launch kernel\n    int threadsPerBlock = 64;\n    int blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;\n    fillKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_arr, val, N);\n    printf("Kernel launched.\\n");\n\n    // <<< Good practice >>>\n    // Synchronize before resetting to ensure all pending work is finished\n    // and any errors are reported.
