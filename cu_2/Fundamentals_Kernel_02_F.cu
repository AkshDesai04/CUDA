The plan:\n\n1. Include the standard headers: `<stdio.h>` and `<cuda_runtime.h>`.\n2. Define a simple kernel that prints its thread index.  \n   The kernel will be launched with a few blocks and threads so that several `printf` calls occur concurrently on the device.\n3. In `main()`:\n   - Print a message from the host *before* launching the kernel.\n   - Launch the kernel asynchronously.\n   - Immediately print another message from the host *after* the launch.  \n     Because the kernel executes asynchronously, this host message may appear before, after, or interleaved with some device prints.\n   - Call `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` so the program waits for all device prints to finish before exiting.\n   - Optionally, print one more host message after the synchronization to show that all device output has completed.\n4. Add a simple error‑checking macro for CUDA API calls to keep the example clean.\n\nThe resulting program is a minimal, compilable `.cu` file that will exhibit the non‑deterministic ordering when run. No external dependencies are required beyond a CUDA toolkit. \n"""\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n// Simple error checking macro\n#define CUDA_CHECK(call)                                                       \\\n    do {                                                                       \\\n        cudaError_t err = (call);                                              \\\n        if (err != cudaSuccess) {                                              \\\n            fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error at %s:%d: %s\\n", __FILE__, __LINE__,   \\\n                    cudaGetErrorString(err));                                \\\n            return EXIT_FAILURE;                                               \\\n        }                                                                      \\\n    } while (0)\n\n// Kernel that prints from each thread\n__global__ void printKernel() {\n    int tid = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;\n    printf("Device: Thread %d\\n", tid);\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    // Host-side print before kernel launch\n    printf("Host: Before kernel launch\\n");\n\n    // Launch kernel with 2 blocks of 4 threads each\n    dim3 blocks(2);\n    dim3 threads(4);\n    printKernel<<<blocks, threads>>>();\n\n    // Host-side print immediately after kernel launch\n    printf("Host: After kernel launch\\n");\n\n    // Wait for all device work to finish\n    CUDA_CHECK(cudaDeviceSynchronize());\n\n    // Optional host-side print after synchronization\n    printf("Host: After device synchronization\\n");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n', images=None, tool_calls=None)
