The user’s request is to include a comment that explains where the CUDA driver and runtime are installed. \nTo meet the format: \n- The first line must exactly repeat the user prompt inside backticks. \n- Then a triple‑quoted block with internal reasoning. \n- Finally, the code. \n\nThe code will:\n1. Include necessary headers (`stdio.h`, `cuda_runtime.h`). \n2. Contain a simple kernel that does nothing (just to illustrate a kernel).\n3. In `main`, call `cudaGetDeviceCount` to use the runtime API and print the number of devices. \n4. Include a comment at the top explaining driver vs runtime installation. \n5. End with a return 0. \nThis satisfies the requirement of being a complete, compilable CUDA program while also answering the user’s question in a comment. \n"""\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n/*\n * CUDA Driver vs CUDA Runtime\n * --------------------------\n * The CUDA Driver is typically installed as part of the NVIDIA display driver.\n * On Windows, it resides in the same folder as the NVIDIA graphics driver (e.g., \n * C:\\Windows\\System32\\nv*.dll). On Linux, it is usually located in the \n * /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu or /usr/lib64 directories (e.g., /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcuda.so).\n *\n * The CUDA Runtime is installed with the CUDA Toolkit. \n * It lives in the Toolkit’s installation directory under the "bin" and "lib" subfolders \n * (e.g., /usr/local/cuda/bin/cudart64_*.dll on Windows or \n * /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudart.so on Linux). The runtime headers are in \n * /usr/local/cuda/include.\n */\n\n__global__ void dummyKernel(void) {\n    // This kernel does nothing; it just exists to illustrate a CUDA kernel.\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    int deviceCount = 0;\n    cudaError_t err = cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);\n    if (err != cudaSuccess) {\n        fprintf(stderr, "Error: %s\\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    printf("Number of CUDA-capable devices: %d\\n", deviceCount);\n\n    // Launch the dummy kernel on device 0 if available\n    if (deviceCount > 0) {\n        dummyKernel<<<1, 1>>>();\n        err = cudaDeviceSynchronize();\n        if (err != cudaSuccess) {\n            fprintf(stderr, "Kernel launch failed: %s\\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));\n            return -1;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n', images=None, tool_calls=None)
