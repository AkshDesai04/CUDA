Use a 2D block (`threadIdx.x`, `threadIdx.y`) and a 2D grid (`blockIdx.x`, `blockIdx.y`).\n2. Inside the kernel, compare `threadIdx.x` and `threadIdx.y`. If equal, use `printf` to output the special message.\n3. For other threads, print a generic message.\n4. Since `printf` in kernels is supported on devices of compute capability 2.0 or higher, compile with an appropriate architecture flag (e.g., `-arch=sm_52`).\n5. The host code will launch the kernel with a small number of blocks and threads to keep output manageable.\n6. Error checking is omitted for brevity but could be added.\n7. The program is selfâ€‘contained and can be compiled with `nvcc -arch=sm_52 diagonal.cu -o diagonal`.\n\nBelow is the complete CUDA C source code.', images=None, tool_calls=None)
