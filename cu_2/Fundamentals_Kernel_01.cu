The kernel should be launched with a single block containing a single thread. The host code (the `main` function) should print \'Kernel launched successfully!\' after the kernel launch. The kernel itself will be empty.`\n\n""" \nThe task is straightforward: create a minimal CUDA C program that launches an empty kernel with a single block of a single thread. After the kernel launch, the host code should output a confirmation message. \nKey points to include:\n- Include <stdio.h> for printf.\n- Define an empty kernel `__global__ void helloKernel() {}`.\n- In main, launch the kernel with <<<1,1>>>.\n- Immediately after the launch, print "Kernel launched successfully!".\n- No error handling or synchronization is strictly required, but calling cudaDeviceSynchronize or checking errors is good practice; however, the prompt only requires printing after launch.\n- Ensure the program is a complete, compilable CUDA C file (.cu) with a `int main()` returning 0.\n"""\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n__global__ void helloKernel()\n{\n    // Empty kernel\n}\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // Launch the kernel with 1 block and 1 thread\n    helloKernel<<<1, 1>>>();\n\n    // Print confirmation message\n    printf("Kernel launched successfully!\\n");\n\n    return 0;\n}', images=None, tool_calls=None)
