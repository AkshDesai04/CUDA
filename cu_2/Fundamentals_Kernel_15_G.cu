What is the program\'s behavior?`\n\n""" \nThe goal is to demonstrate the effect of launching a quick kernel followed by a kernel that never terminates. Because CUDA kernel launches are asynchronous but serialized on the default stream, the fast kernel will run to completion before the hanging kernel starts. After launching the fast kernel we synchronize to make sure it finished, then launch the hanging kernel. The hanging kernel contains an infinite loop, so it will never return to the host. As a result, the program will print a message from the fast kernel, launch the hanging kernel, and then never exit or return to the host. If we print a message immediately after launching the hanging kernel, that message will appear, but the program will block indefinitely at the infinite loop inside the kernel. This demonstrates that a hanging kernel stalls the GPU and the host program until it is terminated manually (e.g., by killing the process or resetting the device)."""\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n// Simple error checking macro\n#define CHECK_CUDA(call)                                            \\\n    do {                                                            \\\n        cudaError_t err = call;                                     \\\n        if (err != cudaSuccess) {                                   \\\n            fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error in %s (%s:%d): %s\\n",       \\\n                    #call, __FILE__, __LINE__, cudaGetErrorString(err)); \\\n            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);                                     \\\n        }                                                           \\\n    } while (0)\n\n// A fast kernel that does trivial work\n__global__ void fastKernel() {\n    if (threadIdx.x == 0 && blockIdx.x == 0) {\n        printf("Fast kernel executed\\n");\n    }\n}\n\n// A hanging kernel that runs forever\n__global__ void hangingKernel() {\n    // Infinite loop â€“ this kernel never returns\n    while (true) { }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    // Ensure we have a device\n    int deviceCount = 0;\n    CHECK_CUDA(cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount));\n    if (deviceCount == 0) {\n        fprintf(stderr, "No CUDA devices found.\\n");\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\n    }\n    CHECK_CUDA(cudaSetDevice(0));\n\n    // Launch the fast kernel\n    fastKernel<<<1, 1>>>();\n    CHECK_CUDA(cudaGetLastError());\n\n    // Synchronize to wait for the fast kernel to finish\n    CHECK_CUDA(cudaDeviceSynchronize());\n    printf("Fast kernel finished and synchronized.\\n");\n\n    // Launch the hanging kernel\n    hangingKernel<<<1, 1>>>();\n    CHECK_CUDA(cudaGetLastError());\n    printf("Hanging kernel launched.
