Call it without cudaDeviceSynchronize. The host program finishes almost instantly. Now add cudaDeviceSynchronize. The host program now waits for the kernel to complete.`\n\n"""\nThe goal is to create a minimal CUDA C program that demonstrates the asynchronous nature of kernel launches and the effect of cudaDeviceSynchronize on host execution time. \n\nRequirements:\n- A kernel that contains a long but finite loop. It should run quickly enough on the host (i.e., kernel launch is asynchronous) but take a noticeable amount of time to finish on the device.\n- Launch this kernel twice: once without calling cudaDeviceSynchronize, and once with the call. \n- Print statements before and after each launch to observe the host side behavior.\n- Include error checking for CUDA API calls and kernel launch failures.\n- Keep the kernel simple: launch with a single thread (1 block, 1 thread) to avoid any interference with thread synchronization, and perform a loop that increments a counter until a given threshold.\n\nImplementation details:\n1. Define a `__global__` kernel `longLoopKernel(long long threshold)` that uses a local counter and a `while` loop that runs until `counter < threshold`.  \n2. In `main`, set a threshold value (`1e9` is a good starting point for a noticeable delay).  \n3. First launch: `longLoopKernel<<<1,1>>>(threshold);` followed by `printf` statements that show the program continues without waiting.  \n4. Second launch: same kernel launch but followed by `cudaDeviceSynchronize();` to force the host to wait.  \n5. After the sync, print a message indicating the kernel has finished.  \n6. Wrap all CUDA calls with a simple error-checking macro to report any issues.  \n\nThe program should compile with `nvcc` and run on a CUDA-capable GPU. It will demonstrate that without `cudaDeviceSynchronize`, the host program exits immediately after the kernel launch, whereas with synchronization, the host blocks until the kernel completes.\n\n"""\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n#define CUDA_CHECK(call)                                                    \\\n    do {                                                                    \\\n        cudaError_t err = call;                                             \\\n        if (err != cudaSuccess) {                                           \\\n            fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error at %s:%d: %s\\n",                    \\\n                    __FILE__, __LINE__, cudaGetErrorString(err));           \\\n            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);                                             \\\n        }                                                                   \\\n    } while (0)\n\n// Kernel with a very long but finite loop\n__global__ void longLoopKernel(long long threshold)\n{\n    long long counter = 0;\n    while (counter < threshold)\n    {\n        counter++;\n    }\n}\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    const long long THRESHOLD = 1000000000LL; // 1e9 iterations\n\n    printf("Launching kernel without cudaDeviceSynchronize...\\n");\n    longLoopKernel<<<1, 1>>>(THRESHOLD);\n    CUDA_CHECK(cudaGetLastError()); // Check for launch errors\n\n    // Host does not wait for kernel to finish\n    printf("Kernel launched.
