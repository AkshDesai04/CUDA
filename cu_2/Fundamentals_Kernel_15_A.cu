You should see the GPU utilization at 100%.`\n\n""" \nThe goal is to provide a minimal CUDA C program that launches a kernel which runs indefinitely, keeping the GPU busy and showing 100% utilization when monitored with `nvidia-smi`. \n\nKey points:\n- The kernel must not exit. A simple `while(true){}` loop suffices, but to avoid being optimized away we will reference a volatile memory location. \n- We\'ll launch a single thread in a single block; even one thread doing an infinite loop will keep the GPU occupied.\n- The kernel is decorated with `__noinline__` to ensure the compiler keeps the loop.\n- The host code will launch the kernel and then block indefinitely (e.g., `cudaDeviceSynchronize()`) so that the program stays alive.\n- We will check for CUDA errors in a basic way, but the main focus is on the infinite kernel.\n- This program is intended for demonstration and should be run on a system with an NVIDIA GPU.\n\n"""\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n// Helper macro for checking CUDA errors\n#define CUDA_CHECK(call)                                                          \\\n    do {                                                                           \\\n        cudaError_t err = call;                                                   \\\n        if (err != cudaSuccess) {                                                 \\\n            fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error in %s (%s:%d): %s\\n",                    \\\n                    #call, __FILE__, __LINE__, cudaGetErrorString(err));          \\\n            return 1;                                                             \\\n        }                                                                          \\\n    } while (0)\n\n// A simple kernel that runs forever\n__global__ void infinite_kernel(void) {\n    // Use a volatile pointer to a dummy location to prevent optimization\n    volatile int *ptr = (volatile int*)malloc(sizeof(int));\n    if (ptr) {\n        while (true) {\n            *ptr = *ptr;  // dummy memory access\n        }\n        free((void*)ptr);\n    }\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    // Launch a single thread in a single block\n    infinite_kernel<<<1, 1>>>();\n\n    // Check for launch errors\n    CUDA_CHECK(cudaGetLastError());\n\n    // Wait indefinitely (the kernel is running forever)\n    printf("Infinite kernel launched.
