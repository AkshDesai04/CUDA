Observe what happens and why it doesn\'t work as expected. (Hint: pointer points to host memory).`\n\n""" \nWe need a CUDA C program that demonstrates that a plain char* allocated on the host cannot be dereferenced inside a kernel. The kernel will try to printf the string, but the pointer refers to host memory. Device memory is isolated, so the device will see an invalid address, leading to an error. The program will launch a kernel with a char* argument pointing to a host string, call cudaDeviceSynchronize, and check for errors. The output should show that the kernel fails with cudaErrorInvalidDevicePointer (or similar). Optionally we can show the correct approach (copying the string to device memory) for contrast, but the core of the exercise is to show the failure. We also use device printf, so we compile with -arch=sm_20 or higher. The code will include error checking macros and will print a message after kernel launch. \n"""\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n/* Error checking macro */\n#define CUDA_CHECK(call)                                                       \\\n    do {                                                                       \\\n        cudaError_t err = call;                                                \\\n        if (err != cudaSuccess) {                                              \\\n            fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error in file \'%s\' in line %i : %s.\\n",      \\\n                    __FILE__, __LINE__, cudaGetErrorString(err));              \\\n            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);                                                \\\n        }                                                                      \\\n    } while (0)\n\n/* Kernel that attempts to print a string passed from the host */\n__global__ void printStringKernel(char *str)\n{\n    /* This will attempt to read from the host memory address, which is invalid on the device */\n    printf("Device trying to print: %s\\n", str);\n}\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    /* Host string stored in read-only memory */\n    const char *hostString = "Hello from host memory!";\n\n    /* Launch the kernel with the host string pointer directly (incorrect usage) */\n    printStringKernel<<<1, 1>>>( (char *)hostString );\n\n    /* Synchronize and check for errors */\n    CUDA_CHECK(cudaDeviceSynchronize());\n\n    /* If kernel executed without error, print success message (unlikely) */\n    printf("Kernel executed successfully (unexpected).\\n");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n', images=None, tool_calls=None)
