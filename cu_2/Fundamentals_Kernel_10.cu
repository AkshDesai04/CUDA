Pass an instance of this struct by value to a kernel. The kernel should print one of the struct\'s members to verify it was received correctly.`\n\n""" \nTo implement this task, we will:\n\n1. Define a simple C struct `MyStruct` with two members: an integer `a` and a float `b`.\n2. Create an instance of this struct on the host, initializing `a` and `b` with sample values.\n3. Write a CUDA kernel that accepts an instance of `MyStruct` by value. Inside the kernel we will use the device `printf` to output the value of member `a` (and also `b` for completeness) to verify that the struct was passed correctly.\n4. In the host `main` function, we will launch the kernel with a single thread and block, passing the host struct instance directly as a kernel argument.\n5. Add a simple error‑checking macro to catch CUDA API errors.\n6. Ensure the program compiles with `nvcc` and runs on a device supporting device printf (compute capability >= 2.0).\n\nThe resulting CUDA C program is self‑contained and demonstrates passing a struct by value to a kernel and printing its contents from the device. \n\n"""\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n/* Simple error checking macro */\n#define CUDA_CHECK(call)                                            \\\n    do {                                                            \\\n        cudaError_t err = call;                                     \\\n        if (err != cudaSuccess) {                                   \\\n            fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error in %s (%s:%d): %s\\n",       \\\n                    #call, __FILE__, __LINE__, cudaGetErrorString(err)); \\\n            return EXIT_FAILURE;                                    \\\n        }                                                           \\\n    } while (0)\n\n/* Host struct definition */\ntypedef struct {\n    int a;\n    float b;\n} MyStruct;\n\n/* Kernel that receives the struct by value */\n__global__ void printStruct(MyStruct s) {\n    /* Print one of the struct\'s members */\n    printf("Kernel received struct: a = %d, b = %f\\n", s.a, s.b);\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    /* Initialize a struct instance on the host */\n    MyStruct h_s;\n    h_s.a = 42;\n    h_s.b = 3.14159f;\n\n    /* Launch the kernel with one thread */\n    printStruct<<<1, 1>>>(h_s);\n\n    /* Wait for kernel to finish */\n    CUDA_CHECK(cudaDeviceSynchronize());\n\n    /* Reset device (optional but good practice) */\n    CUDA_CHECK(cudaDeviceReset());\n\n    return 0;\n}', images=None, tool_calls=None)
