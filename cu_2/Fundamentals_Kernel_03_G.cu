Have each thread print its warp ID (threadIdx.x / 32).`\n\n""" \nThe user wants a simple CUDA program that launches a single block with 32 threads (one warp). Each thread should compute its warp ID by dividing its thread index by 32, and then print the result.  \nBecause the block contains exactly 32 threads, the warp ID will be 0 for all threads, but the program demonstrates the calculation and printing of this value.  \n\nImplementation details:  \n- Use the `printf` function from CUDA to print from within a kernel.  \n- Launch the kernel with grid dimension 1 and block dimension 32.  \n- Use `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` in the host to ensure all device prints are flushed before the program exits.  \n- Include minimal error checking to keep the code concise.  \n- The program will compile with `nvcc` and run on any CUDA-capable GPU.  \n"""\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n__global__ void printWarpId()\n{\n    int warpId = threadIdx.x / 32;\n    printf("Thread %d: warp ID = %d\\n", threadIdx.x, warpId);\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    // Launch one block of 32 threads\n    printWarpId<<<1, 32>>>();\n    \n    // Wait for the kernel to finish\n    cudaDeviceSynchronize();\n\n    return 0;\n}', images=None, tool_calls=None)
