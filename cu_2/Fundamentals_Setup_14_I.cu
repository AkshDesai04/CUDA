The code will contain a short comment paragraph explaining the benefits of such overlap: reducing idle GPU time, hiding transfer latency, and improving overall throughput. The program will allocate two vectors on the host, copy them to the device asynchronously, launch a simple element-wise addition kernel, and copy the result back. All operations will use a single CUDA stream, and the overlapping effect will be illustrated by using cudaMemcpyAsync and kernel launch in the same stream. The code will be fully compilable with nvcc. \n"""\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n#define N 1024\n\n/* \n   Overlapping data transfer and computation:\n   By using CUDA streams and asynchronous memory operations, the GPU can\n   transfer data while simultaneously executing kernels on previously\n   transferred data.
