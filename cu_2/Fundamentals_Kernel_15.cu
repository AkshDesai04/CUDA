Launch it. Observe that your program hangs. This demonstrates the asynchronous nature of kernel launches and the importance of cudaDeviceSynchronize for debugging.`\n\n""" \nWe need a simple CUDA program that launches a kernel containing an infinite loop and then attempts to synchronize. \nThe kernel is declared with __global__ and simply loops forever. \nIn the host code, we:\n  1. Set the device (optional but good practice). \n  2. Print a message indicating the kernel launch. \n  3. Launch the kernel with a single thread/block. \n  4. Immediately check cudaGetLastError â€“ this will return cudaSuccess because the kernel launch is asynchronous. \n  5. Print that error. \n  6. Call cudaDeviceSynchronize() which blocks until the kernel finishes.  Since the kernel never finishes, the program will hang. \n  7. Any code after synchronize is never executed. \nThis demonstrates that without synchronize you may not detect problems (like infinite loops) in kernels, because errors are not reported until synchronization. \nThe code includes basic error handling and explanatory comments. \n"""\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n// Kernel that loops forever\n__global__ void infiniteKernel()\n{\n    while (1) {}\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    // Optional: set device 0 (default)\n    cudaError_t err = cudaSetDevice(0);\n    if (err != cudaSuccess) {\n        fprintf(stderr, "cudaSetDevice failed: %s\\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    printf("Launching infinite kernel...\\n");\n\n    // Launch kernel with one block and one thread\n    infiniteKernel<<<1, 1>>>();\n\n    // Immediately check for launch errors\n    err = cudaGetLastError();\n    printf("After launch error status: %s\\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));\n\n    // Synchronize to force host to wait for kernel completion\n    // This call will block forever because the kernel never exits\n    err = cudaDeviceSynchronize();\n    if (err != cudaSuccess) {\n        fprintf(stderr, "cudaDeviceSynchronize failed: %s\\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // This line will never be reached due to infinite loop in kernel\n    printf("Kernel finished (this will never print)\\n");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n', images=None, tool_calls=None)
