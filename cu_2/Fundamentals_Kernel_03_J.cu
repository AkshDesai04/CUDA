Have thread 0 print a message. Then have thread 15 print a message. Then thread 31.`\n\n""" \nThe goal is to launch a single CUDA block containing exactly 32 threads, which is the size of one warp on current GPUs. Inside the kernel, we check the thread index (`threadIdx.x`) and use `printf` to output a message only for the three specific threads: 0, 15, and 31. \nWe include the standard headers (`cstdio` and `cuda_runtime.h`) and enable device-side printing by using the `__global__` kernel. \nIn the host `main` function we launch the kernel with the launch configuration `<<<1, 32>>>`. After kernel launch we synchronize the device with `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` and optionally call `cudaDeviceReset()` to clean up. \nError checking macros are optional; for brevity they are omitted, but could be added if desired. The program is fully self-contained and can be compiled with `nvcc` to produce an executable that prints the expected messages. \n"""\n\n#include <cstdio>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n__global__ void warp_print_kernel()\n{\n    int tid = threadIdx.x;\n    if (tid == 0)\n    {\n        printf("Hello from thread %d\\n", tid);\n    }\n    else if (tid == 15)\n    {\n        printf("Hello from thread %d\\n", tid);\n    }\n    else if (tid == 31)\n    {\n        printf("Hello from thread %d\\n", tid);\n    }\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    // Launch one block with 32 threads\n    warp_print_kernel<<<1, 32>>>();\n\n    // Wait for the kernel to finish\n    cudaDeviceSynchronize();\n\n    // Optional: reset device (clean up)\n    cudaDeviceReset();\n\n    return 0;\n}', images=None, tool_calls=None)
