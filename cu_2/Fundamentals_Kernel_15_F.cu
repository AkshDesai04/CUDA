Does the main function ever exit? Why or why not?`\n\n""" \nWe need to write a complete CUDA C program that demonstrates a kernel that never terminates (hangs). The program will launch this kernel and then attempt to synchronize on it. Since the kernel contains an infinite loop, the `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` call will block forever. This means the `main` function will never reach its return statement or any code after the synchronization, so it never exits.\n\nThe code will:\n- Include necessary headers (`<stdio.h>` and `<cuda_runtime.h>`).\n- Define a kernel `hangKernel` that runs an infinite `while(1) {}` loop. This loop does nothing and never exits.\n- In `main`, we print a message, launch the kernel with a single block and thread, then call `cudaDeviceSynchronize()`. Because the kernel never completes, the synchronize call blocks forever, preventing `main` from proceeding.\n- Optionally, we include a final `printf` after the sync that will never execute, illustrating that `main` does not exit.\n\nThe program is selfâ€‘contained, compiles with `nvcc`, and when run it will hang indefinitely at the synchronization point. This demonstrates why `main` does not exit: the CUDA runtime waits for all launched kernels to finish before allowing the host program to continue or terminate. \n"""\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n// Kernel that never terminates\n__global__ void hangKernel()\n{\n    // Infinite loop: the kernel never reaches a return or exit point\n    while (1) {\n        // Busy wait\n    }\n}\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    printf("Launching hanging kernel...\\n");\n\n    // Launch the kernel with 1 block of 1 thread\n    hangKernel<<<1, 1>>>();\n\n    // The following synchronization call will block forever because the kernel never finishes\n    cudaError_t err = cudaDeviceSynchronize();\n    if (err != cudaSuccess) {\n        fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error after synchronize: %s\\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // This point is never reached\n    printf("This line will never be printed because main never exits.\\n");\n    return 0;\n}\n', images=None, tool_calls=None)
