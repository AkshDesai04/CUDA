(Generally no).`\n\n""" \nWe need to demonstrate the fact that a CUDA kernel running an infinite loop cannot be cancelled by the host without resetting the device. \nThe most straightforward way to terminate a hanging kernel is to reset the device, which kills all running kernels and clears device state. \nNo CUDA runtime API exists that can asynchronously cancel a running kernel on the same device; attempting to destroy the stream or synchronize will block forever until the kernel finishes. \nThe program below launches an intentionally infinite loop kernel, waits a short time, and then calls cudaDeviceReset to abort the kernel. \nThis illustrates the “no” answer: without resetting the device there is no way to stop it. \nThe code includes minimal error checking and prints messages to show progress. \n"""\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n/* Kernel that runs forever */\n__global__ void infinite_loop(void) {\n    while (1) {\n        /* do nothing */\n    }\n}\n\n/* Helper macro for error checking */\n#define CHECK_CUDA(call)                                                     \\\n    do {                                                                     \\\n        cudaError_t err = (call);                                            \\\n        if (err != cudaSuccess) {                                            \\\n            fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error at %s:%d: %s\\n", __FILE__, __LINE__, \\\n                    cudaGetErrorString(err));                                \\\n            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);                                              \\\n        }                                                                    \\\n    } while (0)\n\nint main(void) {\n    /* Set device (assume device 0 exists) */\n    CHECK_CUDA(cudaSetDevice(0));\n\n    /* Launch the infinite-loop kernel */\n    infinite_loop<<<1, 1>>>();\n    printf("Kernel launched; it will run forever.\\n");\n\n    /* Give the kernel a moment to start */\n    cudaDeviceSynchronize(); /* This will block forever, so we don\'t call it */\n\n    /* Attempt to stop the kernel (there is no API to cancel it directly). */\n    printf("Attempting to stop the kernel without resetting the device...\\n");\n    printf("No API to cancel; proceeding to reset the device.\\n");\n\n    /* Resetting the device aborts the kernel and clears all state */\n    CHECK_CUDA(cudaDeviceReset());\n    printf("Device reset.
