The grid is declared as dim3 grid(4); meaning a 1â€‘D grid of 4 blocks. The block is declared as dim3 block(64); meaning each block contains 64 threads. The kernel will simply print gridDim.x and blockDim.x using device printf. We must call cudaDeviceSynchronize after launching the kernel to ensure the printf output is flushed before the program exits. The program includes basic error checking after kernel launch and device sync. It uses <stdio.h> for printf on host and CUDA runtime headers implicitly via nvcc. The code is self-contained and ready to compile with nvcc. The kernel and launch parameters exactly match the user\'s request.\n"""\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n__global__ void printDims(void)\n{\n    // Only one thread per block prints to avoid clutter.\n    if (threadIdx.x == 0)\n    {\n        printf("gridDim.x = %d, blockDim.x = %d\\n", gridDim.x, blockDim.x);\n    }\n}\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // Declare grid and block as specified\n    dim3 grid(4);\n    dim3 block(64);\n\n    // Launch kernel\n    printDims<<<grid, block>>>();\n\n    // Check for launch errors\n    cudaError_t err = cudaGetLastError();\n    if (err != cudaSuccess)\n    {\n        fprintf(stderr, "Kernel launch failed: %s\\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // Wait for GPU to finish\n    err = cudaDeviceSynchronize();\n    if (err != cudaSuccess)\n    {\n        fprintf(stderr, "CUDA sync failed: %s\\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    printf("Kernel execution completed.\\n");\n    return 0;\n}\n', images=None, tool_calls=None)
