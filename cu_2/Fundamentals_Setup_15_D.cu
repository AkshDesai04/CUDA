Have one thread call cudaDeviceReset() and discuss the potential implications for the other threads.`\n\n""" \nThis program demonstrates how multiple host threads can each set a different GPU device context using cudaSetDevice. \nEach thread will:\n\n1. Set its assigned device.\n2. Allocate a small piece of device memory and launch a trivial kernel to ensure the context is initialized.\n3. Optionally, if the thread is designated to reset the device, call cudaDeviceReset() on its device.\n\nWe use POSIX threads (pthreads) for the host threading model because the program is in plain C. \nError handling is done via a simple CHECK macro that prints an error message and exits on failure.\n\nKey points demonstrated:\n- cudaSetDevice establishes a thread-local context for the specified device. Other threads are unaffected.\n- cudaDeviceReset destroys the context for the current thread on the current device, freeing all resources associated with that context.\n- If one thread resets its device while other threads are still executing kernels or using resources on that device, it can cause errors or undefined behavior in those threads. \n  In this example, each thread uses a distinct device, so the reset does not directly impact the other threads\' contexts. However, if two threads were using the same device and one called cudaDeviceReset, the other\'s context would be invalidated, leading to failures on subsequent CUDA calls.\n"""\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n#include <pthread.h>\n\n/* Simple error-checking macro */\n#define CHECK(call)                                            \\\n    do {                                                       \\\n        cudaError_t err = call;                                \\\n        if (err != cudaSuccess) {                              \\\n            fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error at %s:%d: %s\\n",        \\\n                    __FILE__, __LINE__, cudaGetErrorString(err));\\\n            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);                                \\\n        }                                                      \\\n    } while (0)\n\n/* A trivial kernel that does nothing */\n__global__ void dummyKernel()\n{\n    /* No operation */\n}\n\n/* Thread argument structure */\ntypedef struct {\n    int thread_id;      /* Index of the thread */\n    int device_id;      /* GPU device to use */\n    int reset_flag;     /* 1 if this thread should call cudaDeviceReset */\n} thread_arg_t;\n\n/* Thread function */\nvoid* threadFunc(void* arg)\n{\n    thread_arg_t* t = (thread_arg_t*)arg;\n    printf("[Thread %d] Attempting to set device %d\\n", t->thread_id, t->device_id);\n\n    /* Set the device for this thread */\n    CHECK(cudaSetDevice(t->device_id));\n    printf("[Thread %d] Successfully set device %d\\n", t->thread_id, t->device_id);\n\n    /* Allocate a small buffer on device to establish context */\n    int *devPtr = NULL;\n    CHECK(cudaMalloc((void**)&devPtr, 1024 * sizeof(int)));\n    printf("[Thread %d] Allocated device memory on device %d\\n", t->thread_id, t->device_id);\n\n    /* Launch dummy kernel */\n    dummyKernel<<<1, 1>>>();\n    CHECK(cudaGetLastError());\n    CHECK(cudaDeviceSynchronize());\n    printf("[Thread %d] Dummy kernel executed on device %d\\n", t->thread_id, t->device_id);\n\n    /* If designated, reset the device */\n    if (t->reset_flag) {\n        printf("[Thread %d] Calling cudaDeviceReset on device %d\\n", t->thread_id, t->device_id);\n        CHECK(cudaDeviceReset());\n        printf("[Thread %d] cudaDeviceReset completed on device %d\\n", t->thread_id, t->device_id);\n    } else {\n        /* Free the device memory */\n        CHECK(cudaFree(devPtr));\n        printf("[Thread %d] Freed device memory on device %d\\n", t->thread_id, t->device_id);\n    }\n\n    printf("[Thread %d] Exiting\\n", t->thread_id);\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    int deviceCount = 0;\n    CHECK(cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount));\n    if (deviceCount == 0) {\n        fprintf(stderr, "No CUDA-capable devices found.\\n");\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\n    }\n    printf("Detected %d CUDA device(s).\\n", deviceCount);\n\n    /* For demonstration, we will create as many threads as devices, but limit to 4 to keep the example short */\n    int numThreads = (deviceCount < 4) ? deviceCount : 4;\n    pthread_t threads[numThreads];\n    thread_arg_t args[numThreads];\n\n    /* Assign each thread a distinct device.
