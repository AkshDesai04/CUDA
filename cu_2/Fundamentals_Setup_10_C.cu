The program will contain:\n1. Standard headers (`cstdio`, `cuda_runtime.h`).\n2. A dummy kernel that does nothing but can be launched.\n3. A `main` function that launches the kernel.\n4. The comment explaining L2 cache placed near the top of the file for visibility.\nThe program will compile with `nvcc` and run without errors. \n"""\n\n#include <cstdio>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n/*\n * The L2 cache in a GPU serves as a shared cache between all Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs).\n * Each SM has its own L1 cache (for both instruction and shared data). When multiple SMs\n * need to read or write the same data in global memory, the L2 cache reduces the number of\n * memory transactions to the slower GDDR memory by storing recently accessed words that\n * are shared across SMs. It acts as a hierarchical bridge between the L1 caches and the\n * global memory, improving bandwidth utilization and lowering latency for data that is\n * accessed by many threads or kernels.\n */\n\n__global__ void dummyKernel()\n{\n    // No operation; placeholder kernel\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    // Define grid and block dimensions\n    dim3 block(128);\n    dim3 grid(1);\n\n    // Launch dummy kernel\n    dummyKernel<<<grid, block>>>();\n\n    // Wait for GPU to finish\n    cudaError_t err = cudaDeviceSynchronize();\n    if (err != cudaSuccess) {\n        fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error: %s\\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    printf("Kernel executed successfully.\\n");\n    return 0;\n}', images=None, tool_calls=None)
