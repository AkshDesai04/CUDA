CUDA provides cudaDeviceProp.maxGridSize array, which contains the maximum number of blocks that can be launched along each of the three grid dimensions (x, y, z). The theoretical maximum number of blocks that can be launched in a single kernel launch is simply the product of these three values.\n\nSteps:\n1. Include <stdio.h> and <cuda_runtime.h>.\n2. Create a helper function to check CUDA errors.\n3. In main:\n   a. Determine how many devices are present with cudaGetDeviceCount.\n   b. For simplicity, pick device 0 (the default). In a more elaborate program we could let the user choose, but the prompt only asks for a calculation.\n   c. Use cudaGetDeviceProperties to obtain cudaDeviceProp for the chosen device.\n   d. Extract maxGridSize[0], [1], [2].\n   e. Compute the product as a 64‑bit integer to avoid overflow on devices with very large grid sizes.\n   f. Print each dimension’s maximum and the total product.\n4. Handle errors appropriately (e.g., if no devices are found, or if device properties cannot be retrieved).\n5. Return 0 on success.\n\nThe code will compile with `nvcc -o max_blocks max_blocks.cu` and run on any system with CUDA. \n"""\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n/* Simple error checking macro */\n#define CUDA_CHECK(call)                                                       \\\n    do {                                                                       \\\n        cudaError_t err = call;                                                \\\n        if (err != cudaSuccess) {                                              \\\n            fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error at %s:%d - %s\\n", __FILE__, __LINE__, \\\n                    cudaGetErrorString(err));                                 \\\n            return EXIT_FAILURE;                                               \\\n        }                                                                      \\\n    } while (0)\n\nint main(void) {\n    int deviceCount = 0;\n    CUDA_CHECK(cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount));\n\n    if (deviceCount == 0) {\n        fprintf(stderr, "No CUDA-capable device found.\\n");\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\n    }\n\n    /* For this example, use the first device (device 0) */\n    int device = 0;\n    cudaDeviceProp prop;\n    CUDA_CHECK(cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, device));\n\n    printf("Device %d: %s\\n", device, prop.name);\n    printf("  Maximum grid dimensions (blocks):\\n");\n    printf("    X: %d\\n", prop.maxGridSize[0]);\n    printf("    Y: %d\\n", prop.maxGridSize[1]);\n    printf("    Z: %d\\n", prop.maxGridSize[2]);\n\n    /* Compute theoretical maximum number of blocks */\n    long long maxBlocks = (long long)prop.maxGridSize[0] *\n                          (long long)prop.maxGridSize[1] *\n                          (long long)prop.maxGridSize[2];\n\n    printf("  Theoretical maximum number of blocks per launch: %lld\\n", maxBlocks);\n\n    return EXIT_SUCCESS;\n}', images=None, tool_calls=None)
