/*
Pass a `nullptr` to the kernel and have the kernel try to read or write from it. Analyze the `cuda-memcheck` report for this null pointer dereference.

Thinking:
- The purpose of the program is to intentionally pass a null pointer from the host to a CUDA kernel and then dereference it within the kernel. This should trigger a memory access violation that cuda-memcheck will catch and report.
- The kernel accepts an `int *` argument, which will be a device pointer. On the host side we set the pointer to `nullptr` (i.e., 0) and pass it directly to the kernel launch. Because the pointer is not a valid device memory address, any attempt to read from or write to it inside the kernel will result in an illegal memory access.
- Inside the kernel we will perform a simple write `ptr[idx] = idx;` and optionally a read `int val = ptr[idx];`. This access will cause the GPU to attempt to read/write address 0, which is not a valid device memory region.
- After launching the kernel we check for launch errors with `cudaGetLastError()` and after synchronization with `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` to catch any runtime errors that occur during execution.
- To analyze the failure, one would compile the code with `nvcc` and run it under `cuda-memcheck`:
    ```
    nvcc -o null_deref null_deref.cu
    cuda-memcheck ./null_deref
    ```
  The memcheck output will report an "Invalid device pointer" or "Invalid address accessed" error at the line where the dereference occurs, indicating the kernel attempted to access memory address 0.
- The code is deliberately minimal and selfâ€‘contained; no device memory is allocated because we intentionally want the null pointer dereference to happen.
