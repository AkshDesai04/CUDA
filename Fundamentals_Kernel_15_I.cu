/*
Aim of the program:
Can you stop a hanging kernel from the host code without resetting the device? (Generally no).

Thinking and design:
The CUDA execution model is such that once a kernel is launched on the GPU,
the host thread will not return from the launch call until the kernel has
completed execution.  If a kernel contains an infinite loop (or otherwise
does not finish), the host will block indefinitely on any operation that
requires the kernel to finish (e.g. cudaDeviceSynchronize(), cudaMemcpy,
or any subsequent kernel launch).  CUDA provides no API to forcibly abort
a running kernel.  The only mechanism to recover from a hung kernel is
to reset the device using cudaDeviceReset() (or cudaDeviceReset in newer
runtime versions), which terminates all kernels, resets the device state,
and allows the host to continue.  This reset is a very disruptive operation
and cannot be targeted at a single kernel.

This program demonstrates the impossibility of stopping a hanging kernel
from the host side without a device reset.  It launches an infinite-loop
kernel, then attempts to perform a trivial device query and prints a
message.  Because the kernel never completes, the host blocks on
cudaDeviceSynchronize() and never reaches the print statements.  The
code also shows the correct way to recover: call cudaDeviceReset() and
then continue execution.  The recovery part is commented out because
executing it would simply reset the device after the infinite loop,
but in practice you would need to reset the device to regain control.

    // you can recover from a hung kernel by resetting the device.  This will
    // terminate all running kernels, reset the GPU state, and allow you to

    //
