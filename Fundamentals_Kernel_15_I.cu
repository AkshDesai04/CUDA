Aim: "Can you stop a hanging kernel from the host code without resetting the device? (Generally no)."

The goal of this program is to illustrate the fact that once a kernel has been launched
and is running an infinite loop (or otherwise hanging), the CUDA runtime does not
provide a mechanism to abort or cancel that kernel from the host side without
resetting the device.  The code demonstrates:
1. Launching a kernel that enters an infinite loop.
2. Trying to synchronize with it (which blocks indefinitely).
3. Resetting the device, which forces the kernel to terminate.
4. Observing that there is no API call that can stop the kernel in the middle
   of its execution without resetting the device.

The program is intentionally simple: the kernel does nothing useful, only
spins forever.  The host code launches it, then sleeps for a short time to
let the kernel start executing, then calls cudaDeviceReset() to reset the
device.  The output will show that the kernel was running, that synchronization
would block, and that the reset succeeds in terminating the hanging kernel.
This serves as a practical demonstration that the answer to the question is
"generally no".
