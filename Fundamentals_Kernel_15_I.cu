```cuda
/* 
Aim of the program: 
Can you stop a hanging kernel from the host code without resetting the device? (Generally no).

Thinking:
The CUDA runtime does not provide an API to interrupt or cancel a kernel once it has started executing on the GPU.
The only supported way to abort a kernel that is running forever or stuck in an infinite loop is to reset the
device with cudaDeviceReset() (or by shutting down the driver). Attempting to cancel the kernel from the
host will block on any synchronization call (e.g. cudaDeviceSynchronize()) because the kernel never
completes. 

To demonstrate this, the program launches a simple kernel that enters an infinite loop.
After launching, the host sleeps for a short period and then attempts to cancel the kernel by
calling cudaDeviceReset(). This is the only method that will actually terminate the kernel.
The program shows that without resetting, the host would be blocked indefinitely.

Note: The infinite loop kernel will never return; therefore, any host code that waits for its
completion (via cudaDeviceSynchronize, cudaMemcpy, etc.) will block forever. The program is
intended as a demonstration only and should not be run on production hardware unless you
intend to reset the device afterward.
