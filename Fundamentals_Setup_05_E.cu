/*
If a kernel requires 16KB of shared memory, calculate the maximum number of threads you can launch in a block if the device limit is 48KB per block and 1024 threads (assuming no other constraints).
I first noted that the shared memory requirement stated is per block: each block will consume 16 KB of shared memory. The GPU device limit for a single block is 48 KB, which is greater than the 16 KB needed, so the shared‑memory limit does not restrict the number of threads that can be launched. The only other hard limit mentioned is the maximum threads per block, which is 1024. Therefore, under the given assumptions, the maximum number of threads per block that can be launched is 1024. The program below simply demonstrates this calculation and prints the result.

    // The kernel does nothing; it's only here to show shared‑memory usage.

    const int max_threads_per_block = 1024;       // hardware limit

    if (shared_mem_per_block <= device_limit_per_block)
    {
        // Shared memory does not constrain the thread count
        max_threads = max_threads_per_block;

        // If shared memory were larger than the device limit,
