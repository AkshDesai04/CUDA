Placing `CHECK(cudaDeviceSynchronize())` at the very end of `main` will indeed let you know that *some* error happened on the device, but it has a few limitations:

1. **Detection** – `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` blocks until all preceding work on the device has finished. If any kernel launch, memory copy, or other asynchronous CUDA call failed, this function will return a non‑zero error code, so the macro will trigger an error message. In that sense it is **sufficient to detect that an error occurred**.

2. **Granularity / Debugging** – The error returned by `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` is a generic CUDA error (e.g., `cudaErrorLaunchFailure`, `cudaErrorMemcpy`, etc.). It does **not** tell you which particular kernel launch or memory operation caused the failure, nor does it provide the line number or the device code that crashed. Therefore it is **not very useful for pinpointing where the error happened**.

   For better debugging you typically:
   - Check for errors **immediately after each kernel launch or memory copy** (e.g., `cudaGetLastError()` right after a launch, followed by `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` if you want to catch runtime errors).
   - Use `cudaPeekAtLastError()` to capture launch‑time errors without blocking.
   - Run the program with `cuda-gdb` or Nsight Systems/Compute for a step‑through of device code.
   - Enable `CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1` during development so that each kernel launch blocks until it finishes, making launch errors immediately visible.

In short, `CHECK(cudaDeviceSynchronize())` at the end will tell you an error happened, but it’s not a good strategy for diagnosing *exactly* where or why the error occurred. Use per‑launch checks or debugging tools for precise error localization.
