```cpp
/*
Aim of the program:
Write a kernel that does an infinite loop (while(1);). Launch it. Observe that your program hangs. This demonstrates the asynchronous nature of kernel launches and the importance of cudaDeviceSynchronize for debugging.

Thought process:
- The kernel will never return because it contains an infinite loop. 
- CUDA launches kernels asynchronously; the host thread continues execution immediately after the launch call.
- If we do not wait for the kernel to finish, the program can proceed to subsequent host code. 
- However, if we try to synchronize (e.g., with cudaDeviceSynchronize()) the host will block forever because the kernel never completes.
- To illustrate the async nature, we will print a message right after launching the kernel. 
- We will also provide an optional call to cudaDeviceSynchronize() that is commented out. If you uncomment it, the program will hang, which demonstrates the point.
