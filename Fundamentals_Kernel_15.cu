/*
Aim of the program (word for word as requested):
Write a kernel that does an infinite loop (`while(1);`). Launch it. Observe that your program hangs. This demonstrates the asynchronous nature of kernel launches and the importance of `cudaDeviceSynchronize` for debugging.

Thinking process:
1. Define a simple CUDA kernel that spins forever. `while(1);` is the simplest infinite loop that does nothing but prevents the kernel from exiting.
2. In `main()`, launch this kernel asynchronously with a single block and single thread for simplicity.
3. Print a message after launching to show that the host side continues execution immediately (asynchronous launch).
4. Call `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` to force the host to wait for all kernels to finish. Since the kernel never finishes, the program will hang at this call, demonstrating the need for synchronization in debugging.
5. Add basic error checking after kernel launch and after `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` to show where failures would be caught if the kernel were to terminate prematurely.
6. Keep the code minimal, selfâ€‘contained, and compilable with a standard CUDA compiler (nvcc).
