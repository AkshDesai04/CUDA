```cuda
/*
Aim of the program (word for word as passed in the prompt):
Pass the struct pointer, have the kernel modify it, but forget to copy the data back from device to host. Does the verification on the host pass?

Thinking:
The goal of this simple CUDA program is to illustrate what happens when a kernel writes to a device copy of a struct but the host never copies that updated data back. 
- We define a simple struct `MyStruct` with an integer member.
- On the host we allocate an instance, set it to a known value, and then copy it to device memory.
- A kernel `modifyStruct` receives a pointer to that device struct and increments the integer member.
- Crucially, after launching the kernel we *omit* a cudaMemcpy to bring the updated struct back to the host.
- The host then checks whether the original struct value has changed.
Because we never copied the device-modified struct back, the host still holds the original value, so the verification will fail.

The program prints the original value, the device-modified value (by printing from the host after the kernel launch, but still the original value because we didn't copy back), and a message indicating whether the verification passed or failed.

Note: The code is intentionally simple and does not handle CUDA errors for brevity. In real code you should check return values of CUDA calls.
