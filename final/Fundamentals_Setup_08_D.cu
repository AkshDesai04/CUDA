The CUDA driver is typically installed as part of the NVIDIA display driver. On Windows it resides in the Windows system directory (e.g., C:\Windows\System32) and is bundled with the graphics card driver. On Linux, it is installed in the kernel module directory (e.g., /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/nvidia/) and the NVIDIA driver package provides the low‑level driver.

The CUDA runtime, on the other hand, is installed with the CUDA Toolkit. It consists of the runtime libraries, header files, and utilities that user applications link against. On Windows, these files are placed in the CUDA installation directory (e.g., C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\vXX.X). On Linux, the toolkit is usually installed under /usr/local/cuda or a custom prefix, with runtime libraries in /usr/local/cuda/lib64, headers in /usr/local/cuda/include, and binaries in /usr/local/cuda/bin. The runtime libraries provide the higher‑level API that abstracts away the driver interactions.
