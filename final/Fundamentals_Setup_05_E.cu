/* Aim: calculate the maximum number of threads per block when a kernel uses 16 KB of shared memory, 
   the device allows 48 KB per block, and the theoretical maximum is 1024 threads.

   Thinking:
   - The shared‑memory requirement of 16 KB is per block, not per thread. 
   - The device imposes a shared‑memory limit of 48 KB per block, which is larger than the 16 KB needed, 
     so shared memory is not the limiting factor.
   - The only other hard limit is the maximum number of threads per block, which is 1024 for most GPUs.
   - Thus, the maximum number of threads we can launch is 1024. 
   - The program simply prints this result. */
