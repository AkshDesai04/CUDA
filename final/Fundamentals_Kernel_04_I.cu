```cuda
/* 
Aim of the program: 
Launch with 16 blocks. Have each thread print its block ID multiplied by 10.

Thinking:
The task requires a simple CUDA kernel that outputs the block ID multiplied by 10 for each thread.
Since the instruction is to launch with 16 blocks, we will configure the kernel launch with 16 blocks and 
1 thread per block for simplicity. Each thread will simply call printf with the value blockIdx.x * 10.
Because printf from device code requires a compute capability of at least 2.0, we will use a
`-arch=sm_20` or higher compiler flag. The host code will allocate no additional memory, launch the
kernel, synchronize, and exit. Standard CUDA error checking macros will be added for robustness.
