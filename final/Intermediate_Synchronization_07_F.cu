A global lock (also called a single mutex that protects all shared data) is simple to implement, but it becomes a bottleneck as the number of threads grows. Every thread must serialize its access, even if it is working on data that is completely independent of what other threads are doing. This leads to poor scalability and can make even a well‑designed algorithm run serially in practice.

Below are the main alternatives that can give you much better performance and scalability:

| Approach | What it is | How it reduces contention | Typical use‑case | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------------|---------------------------|------------------|------|------|
| **Lock‑free / wait‑free algorithms** | Algorithms that use atomic primitives (`compare_and_swap`, `fetch_add`, etc.) to coordinate between threads without acquiring a mutex. | Threads proceed in parallel; only a small atomic update may fail and retry. | Concurrent queues, stacks, hash tables, counters, lock‑free lists, etc. | - Very high concurrency.<br>- No priority inversion or deadlock risk.<br>- Can scale to thousands of cores. | - Harder to design correctly.<br>- Requires careful reasoning about memory ordering.<br>- Not all problems admit a lock‑free solution. |
| **Privatization / thread‑local data** | Each thread keeps a private copy of the data it uses, merging updates only when necessary. | No lock is needed during the main operation; only the merge step may need a lock (often a very short critical section). | Per‑thread accumulation, reductions, sparse matrix–vector products, histogram building, etc. | - Very simple to implement.<br>- Excellent scalability when merge cost is low.<br>- No contention during the bulk of work. | - Requires extra memory for each private copy.<br>- Merge step may become a bottleneck if not carefully designed. |
| **Finer‑grained locks** | Partition the shared data structure into smaller regions, each protected by its own mutex (or a small set of mutexes). | Threads lock only the region they actually touch. | Large maps/sets, graph algorithms, spatial partitioning, multi‑level caches, etc. | - Easy to implement if data can be partitioned.<br>- Reduces serialization compared to a single lock.<br>- Can still use standard mutex APIs. | - Lock overhead remains (context switches, contention if two threads target the same region).<br>- Need to avoid deadlocks (order locks or use try‑lock).<br>- Complexity increases if the partitioning is not natural. |
| **Read‑write locks (shared/exclusive)** | Allows many readers concurrently but serializes writers. | If the workload has many reads and few writes, readers won’t block each other. | Caching systems, configuration tables, read‑heavy data structures. | - Keeps many read operations parallel.<br>- Still protects against concurrent writes. | - Writers are still serialized; if write rate is high, this may not help.<br>- Implementations may degrade under heavy write contention. |
| **Transactional memory (TM)** | Software or hardware transactional memory that speculatively executes a block of code and commits if no conflicts. | No explicit locks; conflict detection is automatic. | Complex data structures where the pattern of access is irregular. | - Simplifies reasoning (you write code as if no concurrency).<br>- Can automatically scale with contention level. | - Overhead of conflict detection and rollback can be high.<br>- Limited by hardware support; not always available. |
| **Lock‑coarse with adaptive granularity** | Dynamically switch between a global lock and finer locks based on observed contention. | System adapts: if contention is low, use a global lock for simplicity; if high, subdivide. | Hybrid systems that need both simplicity and scalability. | - Can give best of both worlds. | - Adds runtime complexity and tuning. |

### Choosing the Right Approach

1. **Identify the contention hotspots**  
   - Profile the application.  
   - Is contention concentrated on a few variables or spread out over a large data structure?

2. **Measure the cost of a lock vs. the cost of a retry**  
   - If a single atomic operation fails often, a lock‑free algorithm may still be worthwhile.  
   - If the lock is rarely acquired, a fine‑grained lock or read‑write lock may be sufficient.

3. **Consider the memory footprint**  
   - Privatization often doubles memory usage; is that acceptable?

4. **Check the feasibility of lock‑free design**  
   - Many libraries (e.g., `concurrentqueue`, `tbb::concurrent_hash_map`) already provide proven lock‑free containers.

5. **Simplify where possible**  
   - Fewer locks = less chance of deadlock, easier to maintain.  
   - Prefer a clean partitioning (e.g., hash‑based sharding) before resorting to more exotic techniques.

### Example Scenarios

| Scenario | Recommended approach | Why |
|----------|----------------------|-----|
| High‑throughput log writer (many threads append) | Lock‑free ring buffer or MPMC queue | Append is atomic; readers can consume without blocking. |
| Parallel reduction (sum of an array) | Thread‑local partial sums → final reduction | No locking during per‑thread accumulation; only a single merge. |
| Large graph processing with frequent edge updates | Fine‑grained locks per vertex or per subgraph | Updates to one vertex rarely interfere with others. |
| Configuration cache heavily read, rarely updated | Read‑write lock | Readers run concurrently; occasional updates acquire exclusive lock. |
| Complex shared structure with irregular access patterns | Transactional memory (if supported) | Avoid manual lock management; let TM detect conflicts. |

In practice, the *combination* of techniques is often used: a lock‑free queue for inter‑thread communication, thread‑private buffers for intermediate results, and fine‑grained locks only for the parts that are hard to make lock‑free. Start with the simplest approach that meets correctness, profile, and then iterate.
