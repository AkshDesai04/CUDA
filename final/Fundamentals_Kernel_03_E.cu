```c
/* 
Aim of the program: Modify the kernel so that only threads in the first half of the block (i.e., threadIdx.x < blockDim.x / 2) print their ID.

Thinking process:
1. We need a simple CUDA program that launches a kernel where each thread can print its ID using device printf.
2. The modification requirement is straightforward: inside the kernel we add an `if` guard that checks whether `threadIdx.x < blockDim.x / 2`. Only those threads will execute the printf.
3. For clarity and demonstration, we choose a small number of threads per block (e.g., 8) and a few blocks (e.g., 2).
4. After kernel launch, we call cudaDeviceSynchronize() to ensure all device output is flushed before the host program exits.
5. We'll include minimal error checking for kernel launch and device sync for robustness.
6. The output will show IDs only for the first half of threads in each block.

The code below implements these steps.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// Kernel that prints thread IDs only for the first half of each block
__global__ void printHalfThreadIds()
{
    // Calculate half of the block size
    int halfBlock = blockDim.x / 2;

    // Only threads in the first half will print
    if (threadIdx.x < halfBlock)
    {
        printf("Block %d, Thread %d\n", blockIdx.x, threadIdx.x);
    }
}

int main()
{
    // Configuration: 8 threads per block, 2 blocks
    const int threadsPerBlock = 8;
    const int numBlocks = 2;

    // Launch the kernel
    printHalfThreadIds<<<numBlocks, threadsPerBlock>>>();

    // Check for launch errors
    cudaError_t err = cudaGetLastError();
    if (err != cudaSuccess)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "Kernel launch failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
        return -1;
    }

    // Wait for device to finish
    err = cudaDeviceSynchronize();
    if (err != cudaSuccess)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "Device sync failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
        return -1;
    }

    // Reset device (optional)
    cudaDeviceReset();

    return 0;
