```c
/*
Launch the empty kernel with a configuration of 1 block and 1 thread.

My approach to this problem is to keep the code minimal while demonstrating a complete CUDA
program structure. I will:

1. Define a kernel named `emptyKernel` that does nothing (just a placeholder).
2. In `main()`, set the device to device 0 (the default) and launch the kernel with a
   launch configuration of 1 block and 1 thread.
3. Synchronize the device to make sure the kernel has finished executing before the
   program exits.
4. Add a simple error-checking macro to capture any CUDA API errors.
5. Include necessary headers (`<cuda_runtime.h>`, `<stdio.h>`).
6. Compile with `nvcc` to generate an executable.

The kernel is intentionally empty, but it demonstrates the correct syntax for a kernel
declaration and launch. The configuration uses `<<<1, 1>>>` which creates a single
block with a single thread, matching the requirement.

No external dependencies or complex logic are needed for this trivial example.
