```cpp
/*
Aim of the program:
Modify the program to print 'Hello from host!' before the kernel launch and 'Kernel finished!' after the kernel launch.

Thinking:
- The original requirement was to print a message from the host before launching a CUDA kernel, and a second message after the kernel has finished executing.
- The simplest CUDA program to demonstrate this is a kernel that performs no work (or a trivial operation). 
- We use printf from the host side to output "Hello from host!".
- The kernel launch is followed by cudaDeviceSynchronize() to ensure the kernel has completed before printing "Kernel finished!".
- Basic error checking is included for robustness, but the main focus is the two print statements surrounding the kernel launch.
- The code is selfâ€‘contained, compiles as a .cu file, and does not rely on any external libraries beyond the CUDA runtime.
