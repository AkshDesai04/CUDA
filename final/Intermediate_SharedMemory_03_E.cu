Aim of the program:
Can threads in different blocks synchronize with __syncthreads()? Explain why not.

Thinking behind the implementation:
- The CUDA function __syncthreads() is a barrier that only synchronizes threads
  within the *same* block. It guarantees that all threads in a block reach the
  barrier before any of them can proceed past it.  It does not provide any
  ordering or visibility guarantees between threads that belong to *different*
  blocks.

- To illustrate this, the program launches a kernel with two blocks, each
  containing a single thread.  Block 0 writes a value to a global integer
  `dFlag`.  Block 1 reads that global integer after its own __syncthreads
  (which only synchronizes the single thread in its block).  Since there is
  no mechanism to guarantee that block 0 has finished writing before block 1
  reads, the read performed by block 1 may observe the old value (0) or the
  new value (1), depending on the interleaving of the two blocks.

- The kernel also records the value read by block 1 into a global array
  `dResults`, which the host later copies back and prints.  If the host sees
  the value 0, it demonstrates that __syncthreads did not synchronize the
  two blocks.  If it sees 1, it is still not a guarantee; the correct
  behavior is that the result is nondeterministic.

- After the kernel launch, the host calls cudaDeviceSynchronize() to ensure
  that the kernel has finished executing before accessing device memory.

- The program is intentionally simple so that the nondeterministic behavior
  (if any) can be observed.  In practice, for crossâ€‘block synchronization
  one must use other primitives such as atomic operations, global memory
  flags checked in a loop, or multiple kernel launches.

This program thus demonstrates that __syncthreads() cannot be used for
synchronization across different blocks.
