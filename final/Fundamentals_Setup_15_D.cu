```cpp
/*
Aim of the program:
Write a program with multiple threads, where each thread sets a different GPU device. Have one thread call cudaDeviceReset() and discuss the potential implications for the other threads.

Thought Process:
1. In CUDA, each GPU device has its own context per process. When a thread calls cudaSetDevice(n), it creates or activates the context for device n.
2. The function cudaDeviceReset() destroys the current context on the device for the calling thread and resets the device to a clean state. All resources (memory, streams, etc.) associated with that context are freed.
3. If multiple threads share the same device, resetting the device from one thread will destroy the context for all threads that were using that device. Subsequent CUDA calls from other threads on the same device will fail until a new context is created.
4. Threads on different devices are isolated; resetting one device will not affect contexts on other devices.
5. In this example we create two threads:
   - Thread 0 will use device 0, allocate memory, launch a trivial kernel, then call cudaDeviceReset() and try to use the device again to demonstrate failure.
   - Thread 1 will use device 1, perform the same operations, and show that its operations succeed because the reset was only performed on device 0.
6. We use simple error checking macros to report CUDA errors and observe the behavior.
