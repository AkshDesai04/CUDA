/*
Write a kernel with an infinite loop where only thread 0 loops forever. The other threads finish. Does the block as a whole ever finish? (No, requires all threads to finish).

Thinking:
- The goal is to demonstrate that a CUDA block will not terminate if any one thread in the block never exits.
- We will create a kernel with one block and a few threads.
- Thread 0 will enter an infinite while-loop (busy-wait), so it will never exit.
- All other threads will perform a simple printf (or any trivial operation) and then exit.
- After launching the kernel, we call cudaDeviceSynchronize() to wait for completion.
- Because thread 0 never finishes, the synchronization call will block indefinitely (or until the CUDA runtime reports a timeout/launch failure).
- Thus the block as a whole never finishes, illustrating that all threads in a block must terminate for the block to be considered complete.
