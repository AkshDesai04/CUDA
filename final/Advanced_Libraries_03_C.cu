```cpp
/*
Aim of the program:
Use a thrust::counting_iterator to initialize a device_vector with the sequence 0, 1, 2, ... without using any host data.

Thinking behind the implementation:
1. We include the necessary thrust headers: thrust/device_vector.h for the container, 
   thrust/iterator/counting_iterator.h for the counting iterator, and thrust/copy.h 
   for copying data from the iterator to the device vector.
2. In the main function we define the size of the sequence (e.g., 10 elements). 
3. We create a thrust::device_vector<int> of that size; initially it contains undefined values.
4. We instantiate a counting iterator starting at 0. 
5. We copy from the counting iterator to the device_vector using thrust::copy. 
   This copies the values 0,1,2,... without generating them on the host.
6. To verify the result, we copy the device_vector back to a host_vector and print the contents.
7. The program demonstrates that all data manipulation occurs on the device, 
   with no host-side sequence creation.

Note: The code is self-contained and can be compiled with nvcc.
