/*
Print the values of `blockDim.x` and `gridDim.x` from within the kernel.
This program demonstrates how to access the builtâ€‘in CUDA variables
`blockDim.x` and `gridDim.x` inside a device kernel and print them
to the console using the device `printf`.  The kernel is launched with a
specified grid and block configuration; each thread prints the values
of these two dimension variables.  Since `printf` from the device is
asynchronous, a call to `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` is made on the host
after the kernel launch to ensure all output is flushed before the
program exits.  The program is kept intentionally simple: it
initializes the launch configuration, runs the kernel, and then exits.
