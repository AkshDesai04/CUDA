```cuda
/*
Launch with a 1D block of 64 threads. Have each thread print its lane ID within its warp (`threadIdx.x % 32`).

Thinking:
- The goal is to create a simple CUDA program that launches one block containing 64 threads.
- Each thread will determine its lane ID within its warp by computing `threadIdx.x % 32`.
- We'll use device `printf` to output the thread index and its lane ID.
- The kernel will be trivial: just the printf statement.
- In the host code, we will launch the kernel with 1 block and 64 threads, then synchronize.
- Include necessary headers (`stdio.h`, `cuda_runtime.h`) and basic error checking for robustness.
- The final output is a single .cu file that can be compiled with `nvcc`.
