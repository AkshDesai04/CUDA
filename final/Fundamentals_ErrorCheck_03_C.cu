/*
Demonstrate its use by launching a kernel with an invalid configuration (e.g., too many threads) and catching the error with `CHECK(cudaPeekAtLastError())`.

Thinking:
The goal is to show how to intentionally trigger a CUDA runtime error by providing an invalid launch configuration, specifically by specifying more threads per block than the device allows (commonly 1024). After launching the kernel, we immediately call `cudaPeekAtLastError()` to retrieve the most recent error. A custom macro `CHECK` is defined to wrap this call, printing the error message but not terminating the program so the demonstration can be observed. The kernel itself is a simple empty kernel; its execution is irrelevant because the launch configuration is already invalid. The program prints informative messages before and after the kernel launch to illustrate the sequence of events. The code is written in C/C++ with CUDA and saved as a `.cu` file, ready to compile with `nvcc`.*/
