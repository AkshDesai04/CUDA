/*
Launch the hanging kernel. Does the main function ever exit? Why or why not?

Thinking:
- The goal is to write a CUDA program that launches a kernel that never finishes (an infinite loop).
- In CUDA, kernel launches are asynchronous by default. If the host program exits immediately after launching the kernel,
  the kernel may be terminated when the process ends, and the program may exit.
- However, if we want to demonstrate that the main function does not exit until the kernel completes,
  we can call cudaDeviceSynchronize() after launching the kernel. This will block the host until the kernel
  returns. Since the kernel is infinite, cudaDeviceSynchronize() will never return, and therefore main will never exit.
- We'll write a simple kernel that runs an infinite loop on each thread. To keep the example minimal, we just use
  a do-while(1) loop. We'll also include some print statements to illustrate the behavior, but the print after
  the synchronize call will never execute.
- The program will compile with nvcc and run on a CUDA-capable device. The main function will print a message,
  launch the kernel, call cudaDeviceSynchronize(), and then attempt to print another message (which will not
  appear because the kernel never completes).
