/*
Write a helper function void launch_empty_kernel() that contains the kernel launch call.

The goal of this small CUDA example is to demonstrate the minimal setup required to
define a kernel, launch it from a helper function, and optionally perform
error checking.  The user requested a function `void launch_empty_kernel()` that
encapsulates the kernel launch.  To satisfy that requirement we need:

1. An empty kernel.  In CUDA this is declared with the `__global__` qualifier
   and can be a no‑op, e.g. `__global__ void empty_kernel() {}`.

2. A helper function that launches the kernel.  Since the kernel is empty and
   does not take any arguments, we can launch it with a single thread in a
   single block.  We use the usual launch syntax:
   `empty_kernel<<<1, 1>>>()`.

3. Optional error checking.  After the launch we can call `cudaGetLastError()`
   and `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` to catch any launch errors and ensure the
   kernel finishes.  This is good practice even for an empty kernel.

4. Boilerplate: include `<cuda_runtime.h>` and optionally `<stdio.h>` so we can
   print any error messages.

No main function is strictly required by the user, but adding one makes the
example self‑contained and runnable.  The main function simply calls
`launch_empty_kernel()` and reports success.

The entire logic is kept minimal: only the empty kernel, the launch helper,
basic error checking, and a trivial main to demonstrate usage.  This file
compiles as a normal CUDA source file (`.cu`) and can be built with
`nvcc example.cu -o example`.  When run, it will exit successfully,
indicating that the empty kernel was launched without issue.
