The **“sticky” error state** in CUDA refers to the way the CUDA Runtime API propagates errors across subsequent API calls once an error has occurred. When a CUDA function (e.g., kernel launch, memory copy, stream creation, etc.) fails, it returns an error code. However, many CUDA Runtime API calls **do not clear this error**; instead, the error becomes “sticky” and remains the current error state until it is explicitly cleared or until the program ends.

### Key points

1. **Error Persistence**  
   - After an error, the global error state is set to that error code.
   - Subsequent CUDA Runtime calls that normally return success will instead return the same sticky error unless they are designed to overwrite it.

2. **Error Clearing**  
   - The function `cudaGetLastError()` returns the current error and **clears** it, setting the state back to `cudaSuccess`.  
   - `cudaPeekAtLastError()` returns the error without clearing it.

3. **Typical Workflow**  
   ```cpp
   cudaError_t err = cudaMalloc(&ptr, size);   // may fail
   if (err != cudaSuccess) {
       printf("Error: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
       // handle error, maybe exit
   }
   // subsequent calls still see the error until cleared
   err = cudaMemcpy(...); // returns the same error if not cleared
   ```

4. **Why It Exists**  
   - Simplifies debugging: you can quickly check if any error has happened so far by calling `cudaGetLastError()` at a convenient point.
   - Prevents cascading failures: once a critical error occurs, you can avoid running dependent operations that would otherwise fail in more obscure ways.

5. **Common Pitfall**  
   Developers sometimes forget to clear the error before continuing, leading to confusing “same error” messages from later calls that are unrelated to the original failure.

### Example

```cpp
cudaMalloc(&d_a, N * sizeof(int));
cudaMalloc(&d_b, N * sizeof(int)); // Suppose this fails

cudaMemcpy(d_a, h_a, N * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
// This call will also return the previous error (cudaErrorMemoryAllocation)
// unless we clear it first.

cudaGetLastError(); // clears the sticky error

cudaMemcpy(d_b, h_b, N * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice); // now runs normally
```

In summary, the sticky error state is a design choice in CUDA’s Runtime API that keeps the most recent error accessible until explicitly cleared, facilitating error checking and debugging but requiring careful management to avoid misleading error propagation.
