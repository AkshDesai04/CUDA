`cudaStreamWaitEvent` and `cudaEventSynchronize` both involve CUDA events, but they serve very different purposes and operate on different levels of execution:

| Feature | `cudaStreamWaitEvent` | `cudaEventSynchronize` |
|---------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| **What it does** | Tells a **device stream** to wait until the specified event has been marked as complete before executing any subsequent work in that stream. | Blocks the **host** thread until the specified event has completed on the device. |
| **Return behavior** | **Non‑blocking**: the function returns immediately on the host; the dependency is enforced only on the device side. | **Blocking**: the function blocks the host thread until the event finishes. |
| **Typical use case** | Establish **device‑side dependencies** between streams, e.g., ensuring that a kernel launched in one stream starts only after an event produced by another stream. | Wait for an event (or kernel) to finish before the host can safely read results, perform CPU work that depends on the GPU, or launch further GPU work that needs the results. |
| **API signature** | `cudaError_t cudaStreamWaitEvent(cudaStream_t stream, cudaEvent_t event, unsigned int flags);` | `cudaError_t cudaEventSynchronize(cudaEvent_t event);` |
| **Flags** | Supports `cudaStreamWaitEventDefault` (blocking on the event in the stream) and `cudaStreamWaitEventDisableTiming` (disable timing of the wait). | No flags. |
| **Effect on other streams** | Only affects the specified stream; other streams are unaffected. | Blocks the host; does not influence other streams. |
| **Performance impact** | No host-side stall; GPU can schedule work after the event becomes true. | Causes a host‑side stall until the event completes, potentially reducing concurrency. |

### Practical example

```cpp
cudaEvent_t e;
cudaStream_t s1, s2;

// Create event and streams
cudaEventCreate(&e);
cudaStreamCreate(&s1);
cudaStreamCreate(&s2);

// Launch a kernel on s1 that writes to a buffer
kernelA<<<grid, block, 0, s1>>>(...);
cudaEventRecord(e, s1);          // Record event after kernelA in s1

// Make s2 wait until kernelA finishes
cudaStreamWaitEvent(s2, e, 0);   // s2 will not start its kernels until e is set

// Later on the host we might need to read the results
cudaEventSynchronize(e);         // Block host until kernelA and the event are finished
```

In the snippet above:

- `cudaStreamWaitEvent` ensures the GPU will *not* execute kernels in `s2` until the event produced by `s1` occurs, without blocking the host.
- `cudaEventSynchronize` forces the host thread to wait until the event (and hence the preceding work) is complete, which is necessary before accessing GPU‑produced data on the CPU or before shutting down the device.
