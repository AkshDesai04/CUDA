/*
Create another asynchronous error: an unspecified launch failure. E.g., a kernel that dereferences a null pointer.

Thinking process:
- The goal is to demonstrate an asynchronous error that manifests as an unspecified launch failure.
- In CUDA, dereferencing a null pointer inside a kernel will trigger an invalid device memory access.
- The error is asynchronous: the kernel launch will not immediately report the failure; instead, the error will surface when the device is synchronized or when cudaGetLastError is called after the launch.
- To illustrate this, we will:
  1. Define a simple kernel that takes an int pointer and attempts to write to it.
  2. Launch the kernel with a NULL pointer argument.
  3. Immediately call cudaGetLastError() to capture any launch error. This may return cudaErrorLaunchFailure or another error code.
  4. Call cudaDeviceSynchronize() to force a device-side error check and retrieve the actual error.
- We'll print the error codes and messages to show that the error is reported asynchronously.
- The code will be a self-contained .cu file, compiled with nvcc, that prints out the error status after both checks.
- Error handling will use the cudaGetErrorString function for readability.
- The program will return 0 on success, or a non-zero error code if an error is detected.
