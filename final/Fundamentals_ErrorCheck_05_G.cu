Yes – although it is uncommon, a kernel launch can return `cudaErrorInvalidDevice`.  
`cudaErrorInvalidDevice` indicates that the CUDA runtime thinks the current device is not a valid CUDA‑capable device. This can happen in a few scenarios:

| Situation | Why it can occur | Typical cause |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Device reset or removal** | A device reset (`cudaDeviceReset`) or removal (e.g. hot‑plug) clears the current context. If the context is lost and you try to launch a kernel without first re‑initializing the device or creating a new context, the runtime will return `cudaErrorInvalidDevice`. | Application called `cudaDeviceReset` or the system removed the GPU. |
| **Multiple contexts / device change** | If you have created multiple contexts or switched to a different device after creating the kernel stream, the kernel may be launched on a context that no longer exists or is not the current device. | Switching devices (`cudaSetDevice`) without destroying or recreating the context. |
| **Driver / runtime mismatch** | Using a CUDA runtime that expects a newer driver version can occasionally cause the runtime to think the device is invalid. | Driver version too old for the runtime. |
| **CUDA Toolkit bug / very old hardware** | In older CUDA releases or on legacy GPUs, certain errors may propagate incorrectly. | Rare, but possible on legacy GPUs. |

### What usually happens in a normal workflow

1. **Select a device**: `cudaSetDevice(0);`  
2. **Create a context**: This is implicit on the first CUDA call after `cudaSetDevice`.  
3. **Launch kernels**: The context remains current until it is destroyed or reset.

In this straightforward sequence, a kernel launch will almost never return `cudaErrorInvalidDevice`. The runtime will instead return errors such as `cudaErrorLaunchFailure`, `cudaErrorIllegalAddress`, or `cudaErrorLaunchOutOfResources` for most failure modes.

### How to avoid it

- **Never reset or destroy a context** before all pending work has completed.  
- **Check the return value** of `cudaDeviceReset` or any call that may invalidate the context.  
- **Re‑initialize** the device (`cudaSetDevice` + any necessary stream/texture bindings) after a reset.  
- **Handle device removal** events if you support hot‑plug.  
- **Keep driver and runtime in sync**.

### Quick example of the error in practice

```cpp
cudaSetDevice(0);                     // Context created
myKernel<<<1,1>>>();
cudaDeviceReset();                    // Context destroyed
myKernel<<<1,1>>>();                  // <-- this may return cudaErrorInvalidDevice
```

The second launch fails because the context created during the first `cudaSetDevice` call no longer exists after `cudaDeviceReset`.

In summary, a kernel launch can return `cudaErrorInvalidDevice`, but it is only when the runtime believes the current device context is no longer valid – usually due to a reset, removal, or improper context management. Under normal, correct usage the error will not occur.
