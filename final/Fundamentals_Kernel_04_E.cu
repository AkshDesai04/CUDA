```cuda
/*
Launch the kernel with a 2D grid of (4, 4) blocks (each with one thread) and have each thread print only its `blockIdx.x`.

Thinking process:
1. The requirement specifies a 2D grid configuration: gridDim.x = 4, gridDim.y = 4. Each block has only one thread, so blockDim = dim3(1,1,1).
2. Each thread should output its blockIdx.x value. Since we have 4 blocks in the x-dimension, the values printed will be 0, 1, 2, and 3 for each block across the 4 rows (y-dimension). 
3. We'll use device-side printf, which requires the GPU to support compute capability >= 2.0. 
4. The kernel will simply call printf("BlockIdx.x = %d\n", blockIdx.x); 
5. In the host code, after launching the kernel, we will synchronize and check for errors.
6. We'll include necessary headers and define a simple main function that sets up the launch configuration and handles error checking.
