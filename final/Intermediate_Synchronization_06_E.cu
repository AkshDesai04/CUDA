```cuda
/*
Try using `__syncthreads()` inside a loop where some threads might exit the loop earlier than others. This will also cause a deadlock.
 
The following CUDA program demonstrates a classic deadlock scenario caused by calling __syncthreads() inside a loop where not all threads execute the synchronization call. Each thread runs a loop that increments a counter until a per-thread threshold is reached. If a thread reaches its threshold, it exits the loop prematurely. However, all threads—including those that exit early—still hit the __syncthreads() call at the end of each loop iteration. Since some threads skip the sync, the remaining threads will wait forever at that point, resulting in a deadlock. The program intentionally triggers this situation to illustrate the importance of ensuring that all threads in a block execute every __syncthreads() call in the same iteration.
 
The kernel below is deliberately simple: it uses a shared counter array in global memory, one element per thread. Each thread loops, checks if its counter has reached a threshold, and if not, increments it. After the check, the thread calls __syncthreads() to synchronize the block. Because the exit condition depends on the thread index, some threads finish earlier, leading to an imbalance and the deadlock. The host code launches the kernel and prints a message (if the kernel terminates; it will not terminate normally due to the deadlock). In practice, the program will hang, and you may need to kill it manually or observe a timeout.
