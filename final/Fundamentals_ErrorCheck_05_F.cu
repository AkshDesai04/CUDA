```c
/*
 * Aim of the program: What happens if you have 0 CUDA devices and you try to cudaSetDevice(0)?
 *
 * Thinking process:
 * 1. The program aims to demonstrate the behavior of the CUDA runtime when there are no devices
 *    available on the system and the user attempts to set a device by calling cudaSetDevice(0).
 * 2. We need to query the number of CUDA-capable devices using cudaGetDeviceCount. If the count
 *    is zero, we still attempt to set device 0.
 * 3. The CUDA runtime will return an error code (cudaErrorNoDevice) indicating that there are
 *    no devices to set. We capture this error and print it using cudaGetErrorString to provide
 *    a human-readable description.
 * 4. The code is written in plain C using CUDA runtime API functions. It is selfâ€‘contained and
 *    can be compiled with nvcc. No external libraries or additional files are required.
 * 5. The program also handles the case when devices are present; it sets device 0 and reports
 *    success, to illustrate the normal path.
 * 6. Error handling is performed after each CUDA call by checking the returned cudaError_t.
 * 7. The output of the program will clearly indicate whether cudaSetDevice succeeded or failed
 *    and why, demonstrating the effect of having zero CUDA devices.
