/*
Trigger the error by passing a `nullptr` for the pointer-to-a-pointer in `cudaMalloc` (`cudaMalloc(nullptr, 100)`)

Thinking:
The goal is to deliberately cause an error in CUDA by calling cudaMalloc with a null pointer for the device pointer argument. The cudaMalloc API expects a non-NULL address of a pointer variable where it will store the device memory address. Passing nullptr violates the API contract and should result in a CUDA error. The program will:
1. Include necessary headers.
2. Call cudaMalloc with nullptr and a size of 100 bytes.
3. Capture the returned cudaError_t.
4. Print the error code and the corresponding error string using cudaGetErrorString.
5. Return the error code as the program's exit status.
This demonstrates the error handling mechanism in CUDA for invalid device pointer usage. */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

int main(void)
{
    // Attempt to allocate memory on the device, but pass nullptr as the pointer-to-a-pointer
    size_t size = 100;
    cudaError_t err = cudaMalloc(nullptr, size);

    // Print the result
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        printf("cudaMalloc returned error: %d (%s)\n", err, cudaGetErrorString(err));
    } else {
        printf("Unexpectedly succeeded in cudaMalloc with nullptr!\n");
    }

    return err;
