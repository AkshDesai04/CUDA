/*
Try to `cudaMalloc` zero bytes. Does it return an error or a valid pointer?

Thinking process:
- The CUDA runtime API `cudaMalloc(void **devPtr, size_t size)` is documented to
  allocate `size` bytes on the device. However, the specification does not
  explicitly forbid a size of zero. Many drivers return `cudaSuccess` for a zero
  allocation and set `*devPtr` to a non-NULL pointer that should not be
  dereferenced. Some drivers may return `NULL` or a unique dummy pointer.
- We want to test what happens on a typical recent CUDA driver (e.g. 11.x or
  12.x). To make the test informative, we will:
  1. Call `cudaMalloc(&ptr, 0)` and check the return value.
  2. Print the error code and error string.
  3. Print the value of the returned pointer (`ptr`).
  4. Attempt to free the pointer (freeing a NULL or a dummy pointer is safe).
  5. (Optional) Query the available device memory before and after to show
     that no memory is actually consumed.
- We will include basic error handling: if `cudaMalloc` fails with an error
  other than `cudaSuccess`, we print it. If it succeeds, we examine the
  pointer. Some drivers may return a pointer that is not NULL; others may
  return NULL but still succeed.
- The program is self‑contained and can be compiled with `nvcc`:
  `nvcc test_cudamalloc_zero.cu -o test_cudamalloc_zero`
  and run on a system with a CUDA‑capable GPU.
