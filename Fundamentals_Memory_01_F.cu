```cuda
/*
 * Try to `cudaMalloc` zero bytes. Does it return an error or a valid pointer?
 *
 * My thinking:
 * 1. According to the CUDA Runtime API documentation, cudaMalloc can be called with a size of 0. The behavior is that the call will succeed and a non-NULL pointer may be returned, but the pointer is not meant to be dereferenced.
 * 2. Some implementations may return NULL pointer, but the status should be cudaSuccess. Other implementations may return a unique dummy pointer.
 * 3. To verify, we will:
 *    - Declare a void* pointer.
 *    - Call cudaMalloc(&ptr, 0).
 *    - Check the returned cudaError_t.
 *    - Print the status, the string representation of the error, and the pointer value.
 *    - Attempt to free the pointer using cudaFree(ptr) to ensure we don't leave a dangling allocation.
 * 4. We need to include the necessary headers, check for errors, and clean up properly.
 * 5. Since the allocation size is zero, the GPU memory usage should not increase. The program should run quickly and exit cleanly.
 * 6. The output will clearly show whether cudaMalloc returned cudaSuccess and whether the pointer is NULL or not, thus answering the question.
