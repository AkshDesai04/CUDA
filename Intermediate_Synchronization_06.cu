```cpp
/*
Aim: Write a kernel that uses __syncthreads() incorrectly, for example, inside a conditional branch (if (threadIdx.x < 16) __syncthreads();). Compile and run this. Explain why this leads to a deadlock and will cause the kernel to hang or error out.

Thinking:
- The __syncthreads() function is a barrier that all threads in a block must reach; otherwise the kernel will hang.
- By placing __syncthreads() inside a conditional that only a subset of threads execute, we create a situation where some threads never hit the barrier while others do.
- The threads that hit the barrier will wait indefinitely for the missing threads, causing a deadlock.
- At runtime the CUDA driver detects that not all threads reached the synchronization point and returns an error (often cudaErrorLaunchFailure or an invalid synchronization error).
- Consequently, cudaDeviceSynchronize() will fail, and the program will either hang or print an error message.

        __syncthreads();
