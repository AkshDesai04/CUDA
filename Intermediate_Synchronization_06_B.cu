```cpp
/* 
Aim of the program:
In the deadlock example, threads < 16 reach the barrier, but threads >= 16 do not. 
The first group waits forever for the second group, which will never arrive.

Thought process:
To illustrate this classic CUDA deadlock caused by a conditional __syncthreads(), 
I create a kernel that launches 32 threads per block. 
Each thread prints a message before the barrier. Then, only threads with threadIdx.x < 16 execute __syncthreads(). 
Since the other 16 threads skip the barrier, the first 16 threads wait forever, leading to a deadlock.
The host code launches this kernel and calls cudaDeviceSynchronize() to observe the hang. 
The program demonstrates the pitfall of conditionally executing __syncthreads().

    // Only threads with index < 16 execute the barrier
    if (threadIdx.x < 16)
    {
        __syncthreads();   // This causes a deadlock because threads >= 16 never reach it
    }

    // This part will never be executed by the first 16 threads due to the deadlock
    printf("Thread %d: after barrier\n", threadIdx.x);
