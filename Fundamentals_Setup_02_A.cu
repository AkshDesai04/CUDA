/*
Aim of the program:
Iterate through all available CUDA devices and print their total global memory in gigabytes (GiB) for each.

Thinking:
1. The goal is to discover all CUDA-capable devices present in the system and retrieve the amount of global memory each possesses.
2. We will use the CUDA Runtime API:
   - cudaGetDeviceCount() to find out how many devices exist.
   - For each device index, cudaGetDeviceProperties() to obtain a cudaDeviceProp structure that contains totalGlobalMem (bytes).
3. Convert totalGlobalMem from bytes to GiB. GiB is 2^30 bytes (i.e., 1024^3).
4. Print the device number, name, and memory in a human-readable format.
5. Handle errors: if cudaGetDeviceCount or cudaGetDeviceProperties fails, we should report the error and exit gracefully.
6. The program should compile as a standard CUDA C++ source file (.cu) and can be built with `nvcc` or any CUDA-aware compiler.
7. Weâ€™ll include <cuda_runtime.h> and <cstdio> for the CUDA runtime API and C-style I/O.
8. Since the program is simple and purely CPU-side, we don't need any GPU kernels.
9. We'll use `printf` for output, which works in host code. We also format the GiB value to, say, two decimal places for readability.
10. Return 0 on success.
