/*
Aim: Can you throw an exception from __device__ code? (No). Explain why.

Thinking:
The purpose of this program is to demonstrate that C++ exceptions cannot be thrown from CUDA device code. 
The CUDA compiler (nvcc) treats device functions separately from host functions and applies a restricted
subset of C++ features to device code. Exceptions are not part of that subset because they rely on
runtime support that is not available on the GPU, such as stack unwinding, exception tables, and
runtime exception handlers. Attempting to throw an exception in a __device__ or __global__ function
causes a compilation error: "error: exception handling is not supported for device code".

To illustrate this, the code below contains a commented-out throw statement inside a __device__
function. If you uncomment it, nvcc will produce a compilation error. Instead, device code should
signal errors by returning error codes or printing messages with printf, and the host can check
cudaGetLastError() or use error-returning kernels.

This simple program launches a kernel that calls a device function and prints a message,
showing that the kernel executes without throwing an exception.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdexcept> // included for reference, but not used in device code

__device__ void deviceFunction()
{
    // The following line would cause a compilation error if uncommented:
    // throw std::runtime_error("Device exception");
    // Device code cannot throw C++ exceptions because exception handling is not supported on the GPU.
    // Instead, we can signal errors by returning error codes or using other mechanisms.
}

__global__ void kernel()
{
    int tid = threadIdx.x;
    if (tid == 0)
    {
        deviceFunction();
        printf("Kernel executed without exception.\n");
    }
}

int main()
{
    // Launch the kernel with one block of 32 threads
    kernel<<<1, 32>>>();
    cudaError_t err = cudaGetLastError();
    if (err != cudaSuccess)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "Kernel launch error: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
        return 1;
    }

    err = cudaDeviceSynchronize();
    if (err != cudaSuccess)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "CUDA sync error: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
        return 1;
    }

    printf("Host: Kernel finished successfully.\n");
    return 0;
