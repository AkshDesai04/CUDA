```c
/*
Pass a `nullptr` to `cudaMemset` and use error checking to catch the invalid value error.

Thinking process:
1. The requirement is to demonstrate passing a null pointer to cudaMemset and to catch
   the resulting error via CUDA error checking.  The error we expect is
   cudaErrorInvalidValue.
2. The simplest way is to call cudaMemset with a null pointer and immediately
   inspect the returned error code.  cudaMemset returns a cudaError_t, so we can
   check it directly without needing cudaGetLastError.
3. For completeness and good practice, we also include basic error reporting via
   printf.  If the call unexpectedly succeeds, we print a message indicating
   that anomaly.
4. Since this is a minimal demonstration, we don't allocate any device memory.
5. The code is a standard CUDA C program compiled with nvcc; it can be saved as
   a .cu file and compiled/run to observe the error.

int main(void)
{
    // Attempt to set memory at a null device pointer.
    // This should trigger cudaErrorInvalidValue.
    cudaError_t err = cudaMemset(nullptr, 0, 1024);

    if (err != cudaSuccess)
    {
        printf("cudaMemset failed as expected.\n");
        printf("Error code: %d, Message: %s\n", err, cudaGetErrorString(err));
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Unexpectedly, cudaMemset succeeded.\n");
    }

    return 0;
