Aim of the program (as requested in the prompt):
"Can a stream wait on an event that has not yet been recorded? (Yes, it will wait until it is recorded and completed)."

My thinking and design for this demonstration:

1. CUDA streams allow asynchronous execution of kernels and memory operations. A stream can be made to wait on an event via cudaStreamWaitEvent. The documentation says that if the event has not yet been recorded, the wait will block until the event is recorded and completed.

2. To prove this, I created two streams (stream1 and stream2) and one event (e). I schedule a kernel on stream1 that will write a value to an array element. Before launching the kernel, I call cudaStreamWaitEvent(stream1, e, 0), meaning stream1 must wait until event e is recorded and finished.

3. I schedule a kernel on stream2 that will write a different value to another array element, then record event e in stream2 immediately after that kernel finishes. Thus the event is recorded only after stream2’s kernel has completed.

4. Because stream1 was instructed to wait on e, its kernel will not start until the kernel on stream2 has finished and e has been recorded. If stream1 did not wait, both kernels would execute concurrently and the array would still contain the same values, but the timing and the order of execution would be different.

5. For a more observable difference, I introduced a small artificial delay in each kernel (a busy-loop) to make the execution time noticeable. I also timed the kernels using CUDA events to demonstrate that stream1’s kernel starts after stream2’s kernel.

6. After synchronization, I copy the results back to the host and print the array contents and the measured execution times. This demonstrates that stream1 indeed waited for event e.

The code below follows this plan, uses proper CUDA error checking, and is fully self-contained. It can be compiled with `nvcc` and run on any CUDA-capable device.
