```cpp
/*
Aim: Write a simple __global__ function (a kernel) that does nothing. In your main function, attempt to compile this file using the NVIDIA CUDA Compiler (NVCC) command line, for example: nvcc my_program.cu -o my_program. Run the resulting executable.

Thinking: 
- The kernel itself should not perform any work; it can simply be an empty function body.
- The main function will launch this kernel once on a single thread/block.
- After launching the kernel we call cudaDeviceSynchronize() to ensure the kernel has finished executing before the host program exits.
- Finally, we print a small message so that when the compiled executable runs we can confirm that the program executed.
- The compilation and execution steps are performed by the user from the command line, as requested. No selfâ€‘compilation logic is included in the source code.
