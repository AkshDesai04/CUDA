`__device__` variables are stored in the device’s global‑memory address space (unless you qualify them with `__constant__` or `__shared__`).  
Therefore, from a performance standpoint they are accessed with the same latency and bandwidth characteristics as memory obtained via `cudaMalloc()`.  

A few practical nuances:

* **Same memory space** – both live in global memory and are subject to the same caching hierarchy (L1, L2, texture cache, etc.).
* **Potential differences in access patterns** – because `__device__` names are resolved at compile time, the compiler may generate slightly different load/store instructions, but the underlying hardware access cost is the same.
* **Qualifiers matter** – if you declare a variable as `__constant__` or `__shared__`, it moves to constant memory or shared memory, respectively, and the access performance changes.
* **Unification** – with Unified Memory or managed memory, `__device__` globals may actually reside in pageable memory that is automatically migrated, but this is an implementation detail and does not change the relative cost to a plain `cudaMalloc()` allocation on the device side.

So, in short, **`__device__` memory is not faster or slower than global memory obtained through `cudaMalloc`; they both occupy the same global‑memory space and have comparable access speeds.**
