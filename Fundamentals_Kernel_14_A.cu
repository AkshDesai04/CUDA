```cpp
/*
Trigger `cudaErrorInvalidConfiguration` by requesting more shared memory per block than is available on the device.

Thinking:
- The goal is to produce the specific CUDA error `cudaErrorInvalidConfiguration`, which occurs when a kernel launch configuration exceeds device limits.
- One common limit is the amount of dynamic shared memory per block. Each device has a property `sharedMemPerBlock` that specifies the maximum dynamic shared memory that can be requested during a launch.
- To trigger the error, we query the device's maximum shared memory per block, then attempt to launch a kernel requesting more than that amount.
- We'll create a simple dummy kernel that declares an external shared memory array (`extern __shared__ int sdata[];`). The kernel itself does nothing.
- After launching the kernel with an oversized shared memory request, we call `cudaGetLastError()` to capture the launch error. This function returns an error code if the launch failed.
- We print the error string using `cudaGetErrorString` so the user can see the exact error (`cudaErrorInvalidConfiguration`).
- The program is selfâ€‘contained, written in CUDA C, and will compile to a .cu file.
