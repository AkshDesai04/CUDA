If the `__syncthreads()` call after the shared‑memory load phase is omitted, the kernel’s execution order among the threads in the same block becomes non‑deterministic. In practice this means that:

1. **Race Condition on Shared Memory**  
   A thread can start executing the next part of the kernel (e.g., a computation that reads from shared memory) before one or more of its sibling threads have finished writing to the shared‑memory location. Because the memory operations are not synchronized, the reading thread may observe stale or garbage data that has not yet been written by its partner threads.

2. **Incorrect Results**  
   The algorithm will produce wrong output. For example, in a stencil or reduction kernel, each thread expects the values that other threads have loaded. If one thread reads an uninitialized element, the final sum or product will be incorrect.

3. **Undefined or Unpredictable Behaviour**  
   CUDA’s memory model allows threads to execute in any order as long as all data dependencies are respected. Without the barrier, the dependency that “all loads must finish before any read” is violated, leading to undefined behaviour that may vary between runs, between GPUs, or even between different kernel launches on the same GPU.

4. **Performance Impact (rare but possible)**  
   In some scenarios, the GPU may issue read operations speculatively. If a read hits an uninitialized value, the GPU may have to stall or perform a fallback read from global memory, causing additional latency.

5. **Debugging Difficulty**  
   The error might manifest only on certain inputs or after a particular number of launches, making it hard to reproduce and debug. It often surfaces as sporadic incorrect results rather than a crash, because CUDA does not guard against data races in shared memory.

In summary, forgetting the `__syncthreads()` after the load phase creates a race condition on shared memory, leading to incorrect, unpredictable, and hard‑to‑diagnose program behaviour. The barrier guarantees that all threads have finished writing before any thread starts reading, ensuring data consistency and correct algorithm execution.
