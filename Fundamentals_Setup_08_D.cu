/*
Explain in a comment where the CUDA driver is typically installed (e.g., as part of the NVIDIA display driver) and where the CUDA runtime is installed (e.g., with the CUDA Toolkit).

My thinking:
- The user asks for an explanation about where the CUDA driver and runtime are installed.
- The developer instruction requires us to output a .cu file and place the aim of the program in a multiline comment exactly as given.
- We should also include our entire thought process in that comment.
- The code itself can be a minimal CUDA program that compiles and runs, demonstrating a simple kernel.
- The explanatory comment about the installation locations can be placed as a separate comment within the file.

/*
 * Explanation:
 * The CUDA driver is part of the NVIDIA display driver. It resides in the driver installation.
 * On Windows, it is typically located under:
 *   C:\Windows\System32\drivers\nvidia*.sys
 * On Linux, it is usually found in:
 *   /usr/lib/nvidia-<driver-version> or /usr/lib64/nvidia-<driver-version>
 *
 * The CUDA runtime is installed with the CUDA Toolkit.
 * On Windows, the toolkit installs under:
 *   C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v<version>
 * On Linux, it is typically under:
 *   /usr/local/cuda or /usr/local/cuda-<version>
