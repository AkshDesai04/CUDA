Aim of the program (exactly as given in the prompt):

Call `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` after the kernel launch. Does this guarantee the `printf` output will appear before subsequent host code executes? Explain in a comment. (Answer: No, `printf` is buffered).

Thinking:
1. The CUDA device `printf` writes to an internal buffer that is flushed either
   when `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` is called or when the program terminates.
2. Even though `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` ensures the kernel has finished executing,
   it does not guarantee that the buffered output is printed to the console
   immediately. The host may still execute code that performs its own output
   before the device buffer is flushed.
3. The host's `printf` calls are also buffered by the standard C library,
   so the ordering of printed messages can appear counterâ€‘intuitive.
4. To illustrate this, we launch a kernel that calls `printf`, synchronize,
   then perform a host `printf`. The output may show the host message before
   the device message because the device output is still in a buffer.
5. The correct answer is that `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` does NOT guarantee
   that the device `printf` output will appear before subsequent host code.
   The output is buffered until the buffer is flushed (which may happen at
   the next synchronization or at program exit).
