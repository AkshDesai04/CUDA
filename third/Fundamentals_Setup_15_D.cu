```cpp
/*
Aim of the program (exactly as given in the prompt):
Write a program with multiple threads, where each thread sets a different GPU device. Have one thread call cudaDeviceReset() and discuss the potential implications for the other threads.

Thinking behind the implementation:
- The program demonstrates that CUDA contexts are per-device, not per-thread. Each thread sets its own device via cudaSetDevice and can create a CUDA context on that device.
- The function cudaDeviceReset destroys the current device context and releases all resources associated with it. It is a global function affecting the calling thread's current device context only. 
- If one thread calls cudaDeviceReset on its device while another thread is still using the same device, the second thread's subsequent CUDA API calls may fail because the context was destroyed. 
- The code creates a simple kernel that does nothing but ensures the context is used. Each thread allocates memory, launches the kernel, and then (in one chosen thread) calls cudaDeviceReset on its device. The other threads then attempt to launch the kernel again or perform a memory copy; they should see errors indicating the context was lost.
- We use std::thread from the C++ standard library to spawn multiple threads. CUDA runtime API is used for device selection, memory allocation, and kernel launches. Error checking is done through a helper macro.
- The program prints which thread is using which device, when a reset occurs, and the results of subsequent CUDA calls. This illustrates the implications for multi-threaded programs that share GPU devices.
