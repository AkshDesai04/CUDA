/*
Check if the device supports host-mapped pageable memory access (`pageableMemoryAccess`).

The goal of this CUDA C program is to query each CUDA-capable device present on the system
and determine whether it supports pageable memory access. This capability is represented by
the device attribute `cudaDevAttrPageableMemoryAccess` available in the CUDA runtime API.
The program performs the following steps:

1. Use `cudaGetDeviceCount()` to obtain the number of CUDA devices.
2. Iterate over each device index.
3. For each device, call `cudaDeviceGetAttribute()` with the attribute `cudaDevAttrPageableMemoryAccess`.
4. Interpret the returned value: a non-zero value indicates that the device supports
   host-mapped pageable memory access; zero indicates it does not.
5. Print a readable message for each device, reporting the support status.

The program includes minimal error checking: it reports and aborts if any CUDA API call
fails. This is sufficient for a simple diagnostic tool and keeps the code concise.

This approach directly uses the CUDA Runtime API, which is the most straightforward way
to query device attributes from a host program. The code is written in standard C
compatible with CUDAâ€™s compiler (`nvcc`) and compiles into a `.cu` file.
