```cpp
/*
Pass the struct pointer, but forget to copy the data from host to device first.
What values does the kernel see when it reads from the struct's members?

Thinking:
In CUDA, when you allocate memory on the device with cudaMalloc, that memory is
uninitialized. It contains whatever bytes happened to be in that region of device
memory previously, which is effectively garbage. If you pass a pointer to such
memory to a kernel and the kernel reads the struct members, it will see those
garbage values, not the values you set on the host. Therefore the kernel will
print arbitrary numbers for each member, typically random integers/floats and
a nonâ€‘null-terminated string (or any leftover data). This demonstrates the
importance of copying data from host to device before using it in a kernel.
