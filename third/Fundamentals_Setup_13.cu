```c
/*
Write a program that queries and prints the clock rate of the primary GPU in kilohertz (kHz).

Thought Process:
- The goal is to retrieve the clock rate of the default (primary) GPU using CUDA runtime API.
- The CUDA runtime provides a struct `cudaDeviceProp` with a member `clockRate` that holds the GPU clock frequency in kilohertz.
- We will:
  1. Include necessary headers (`stdio.h` and `cuda_runtime.h`).
  2. Use `cudaGetDeviceProperties` to fill a `cudaDeviceProp` structure for device 0 (the primary GPU).
  3. Handle any potential errors from the CUDA API call.
  4. Print the `clockRate` value directly, as it is already in kHz.
- The program is minimal, self-contained, and can be compiled with `nvcc` (e.g., `nvcc -o gpu_clock gpu_clock.cu`).
- No extra libraries or support files are required.

int main(void)
{
    cudaDeviceProp prop;
    cudaError_t err = cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, 0); // primary GPU is device 0

    if (err != cudaSuccess)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "Failed to get device properties: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
        return 1;
    }

    printf("Primary GPU clock rate: %d kHz\n", prop.clockRate);

    return 0;
