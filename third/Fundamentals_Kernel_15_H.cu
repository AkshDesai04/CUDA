```cuda
/*
Aim of the program: Write a kernel with an infinite loop where only thread 0 loops forever. The other threads finish. Does the block as a whole ever finish? (No, requires all threads to finish).

Thinking:
- The goal is to demonstrate that if one thread in a block never exits, the entire block will never be considered finished by the CUDA runtime.
- We'll create a simple kernel that checks threadIdx.x.
- If threadIdx.x == 0, the thread will enter a tight while(true) loop that never terminates.
- All other threads will perform a trivial operation (e.g., write to a global array) and then return.
- From the host, we launch a single block with several threads to observe the behavior.
- Since thread 0 never returns, the kernel launch will never complete and the host code after the launch will not execute.
- This shows that a block cannot finish until every thread in the block finishes execution.
- The program also demonstrates the importance of ensuring that no thread gets stuck in an infinite loop if you want the kernel to terminate.
