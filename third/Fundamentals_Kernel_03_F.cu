```cuda
/*
Aim of the program:
Launch the kernel with a 2D block of (8, 8) threads and have each thread print only its `threadIdx.x`.

Thinking process:
1. The requirement is to launch a kernel with a 2D block of 8x8 threads.
   In CUDA, a block is defined by `dim3 blockDim(8, 8);` and the grid can be
   a single block (`dim3 gridDim(1, 1);` or just omitted, since the default is (1,1,1)).

2. Each thread should output only its `threadIdx.x` value. Since `threadIdx.x`
   ranges from 0 to 7 in each row, the output will be repeated for each row
   in the block.

3. Device printing is possible via `printf` in device code. This requires
   enabling the compiler flag `-arch=sm_20` or higher (which is the default
   for recent CUDA versions). We simply call `printf("%d\n", threadIdx.x);`
   inside the kernel.

4. In the host code, we launch the kernel, synchronize the device, and
   optionally check for errors.

5. The program is minimal and selfâ€‘contained. No external files or
   dependencies other than the CUDA toolkit are required.
