/*
Aim of the program:
Write a kernel that calculates the global ID and then prints whether it is even or odd.

Thinking:
The requirement is to write a CUDA kernel that determines each thread's global ID
(i.e., a unique number across the entire grid) and then prints whether that ID is
even or odd. In CUDA device code we can use `printf` to write to the console,
but we must compile with device printf enabled (usually `-arch=sm_35` or higher).
The global ID is computed as:
    gid = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x
Once we have the ID, we use the modulo operator to check if it's even or odd
and then print a message. The host code will launch the kernel with a simple
grid and block configuration so we can see the output for several threads.
The program will include basic error checking for CUDA API calls to ensure
that any launch failures are reported. The final code is a selfâ€‘contained
`.cu` file that can be compiled with `nvcc` and executed directly.
