```cuda
/* 
Write a kernel that is launched with a 1D block of 64 threads. Each thread should print its own thread index within the block, which is accessible via `threadIdx.x`.

My thinking:
- The requirement is straightforward: we need a CUDA kernel that prints the thread index of each thread within the block.
- We'll use a single-dimensional block with 64 threads, so `blockDim.x` will be 64. Since we only need one block, we launch with `gridDim.x` = 1.
- To print from the device, we can use `printf` inside the kernel. The CUDA runtime provides a device-side printf function which outputs to the host console after the kernel execution finishes.
- There are a couple of things to consider:
  * Device-side printf uses a FIFO buffer that can be limited in size. For this simple example, 64 prints are fine, but we can still set a larger buffer just in case by calling `cudaDeviceSetLimit(cudaLimitPrintfFifoSize, 1 << 20)`.
  * We should check for CUDA errors after kernel launch and after synchronization to catch any problems.
  * The code will be compiled with nvcc and run on a device that supports device-side printf (CUDA 5.0+).
- The structure of the program:
  1. Include necessary headers: `<cstdio>` for printf, `<cuda_runtime.h>` for CUDA API.
  2. Define a simple kernel `printThreadIdx` that prints its `threadIdx.x`.
  3. In `main`, set the printf FIFO size, launch the kernel with <<<1,64>>>, synchronize, check for errors, and exit.
- Because we want a complete, compilable .cu file, we also need to include a minimal error-checking helper macro or function.
- All of this will be wrapped in a single file, no external dependencies.
