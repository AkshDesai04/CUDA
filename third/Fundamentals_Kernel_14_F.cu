```cpp
/*
Aim of the program (word to word as requested):
Launch a kernel with a grid dimension of 0. What error does this cause?

Thinking process:
1. In CUDA, a kernel launch requires a positive grid dimension; at least one thread block must be launched.
2. If we set dim3 grid(0, 1, 1) and attempt to launch, the runtime should reject the configuration.
3. The error returned by the runtime in this case is cudaErrorInvalidConfiguration, which is translated to
   the string "invalid configuration argument" when printed via cudaGetErrorString.
4. To demonstrate this, we create a trivial kernel that does nothing.
5. We launch it with a grid dimension of zero, then immediately call cudaGetLastError to capture the error.
6. We also call cudaDeviceSynchronize to ensure any pending errors are surfaced.
7. Finally, we print the error code and human-readable message.

This program will compile with nvcc and, when run, will output the error caused by the zero grid dimension.
