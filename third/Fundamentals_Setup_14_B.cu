```cpp
/*
Aim of the program:
Based on the asyncEngineCount, print a message like 'Device has X copy engines.'
If the count is greater than 0, also print 'Data copy can be overlapped with kernel execution.'

Thinking process:
1. Use the CUDA Runtime API to query device properties via cudaGetDeviceProperties.
2. The asyncEngineCount field in cudaDeviceProp tells us how many asynchronous copy engines a device has.
3. The program will:
   - Determine the number of CUDA devices available.
   - For each device, retrieve its properties.
   - Print "Device has X copy engines." where X is asyncEngineCount.
   - If asyncEngineCount > 0, also print "Data copy can be overlapped with kernel execution."
4. Error handling will be minimal for brevity: if cudaGetDeviceProperties fails, print an error and exit.
5. The code is a selfâ€‘contained CUDA C++ source file that can be compiled with nvcc.
