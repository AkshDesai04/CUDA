/*
Aim of the program:
Modify the previous 'Hello World' kernel to print a message from the GPU itself. 
The single thread in the kernel should use `printf` to print 'Hello from the GPU!'. 
Note that the output from the GPU might appear at a different time than host-side prints.

Thinking:
- I need to write a CUDA kernel that uses the device `printf`.  
- The kernel will be launched with a single block and a single thread.  
- After launching, the host must synchronize to ensure the device printf is flushed before the host prints its own message.  
- I'll include error checking for the kernel launch and the device synchronization.  
- Since the prompt only asks for a single `.cu` file, I'll keep everything in one source file with a proper header comment.  
- The code will compile with `nvcc` and run on any CUDA-capable GPU.
