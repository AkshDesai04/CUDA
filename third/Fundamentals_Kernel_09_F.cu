/*
Aim of the program: Place the __device__ function definition after the __global__ kernel that calls it.
Add my entire thinking to that comment as well. 
The goal is to demonstrate that the program compiles only if a forward declaration of the
device function is provided before the kernel. Without the forward declaration the compiler
will report an error because the kernel references a function that has not yet been
declared. By providing a prototype line before the kernel we satisfy the compiler's
requirement for a visible declaration, and the subsequent definition after the kernel
is accepted. This illustrates the importance of forward declarations in CUDA C, 
mirroring the rules in standard C/C++.
