/*
Launch a kernel with a 2D grid of blocks, for example, 4x4 blocks, each with a single thread. Each thread should print its 2D block index (blockIdx.x, blockIdx.y).

Thinking:
- The goal is to demonstrate a simple CUDA kernel that prints the block indices of each thread.
- Since each block will contain only one thread, the kernel will be invoked with a block dimension of (1,1).
- The grid will be a 4x4 arrangement of blocks, giving a total of 16 threads.
- Each thread uses the built-in `printf` function to output its `blockIdx.x` and `blockIdx.y` values.
- After launching the kernel, we must call `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` to ensure all output is flushed before the program exits.
- A minimal, selfâ€‘contained CUDA program will include the necessary headers, the kernel definition, and the `main` function that sets up and launches the kernel.
- The code is written in standard CUDA C++ syntax and can be compiled with `nvcc` to produce an executable.
