/*
Aim of the program: Try to use a C++ feature not supported by the targeted CUDA version (e.g., advanced templates or C++17 features without proper flags).

Thinking:
The goal is to illustrate a scenario where we intentionally use a C++17 feature that the current CUDA compiler configuration might not support, because we haven't enabled the appropriate language standard flags (e.g., -std=c++17). In this example, I will use a structured binding declaration inside a device kernel, which is a C++17 feature. Additionally, I will use a templated struct with a non-type template parameter that is of type auto, which requires C++17. When compiling this .cu file with a CUDA compiler that defaults to an older C++ standard (such as C++11), we should encounter compilation errors indicating that the used features are not recognized. This demonstrates how failing to set the correct language standard can cause seemingly unrelated compilation failures. The code itself is simple: it launches a kernel that initializes a pair of integers using structured binding and writes the sum to global memory. The kernel is intentionally written in a way that would require C++17 support. */

    out[threadIdx.x] = sum;
