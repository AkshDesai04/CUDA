/*
 * Aim: Explain the difference between a synchronous error (like `cudaMalloc` failing) and an asynchronous error (like a bad kernel launch configuration).
 *
 * In the context of CUDA programming, errors can occur either synchronously or asynchronously, and it is important to understand how they are reported and handled.
 *
 * 1. Synchronous errors
 *    - These errors happen immediately as the API call is made.
 *    - The function returns a non-zero error code that can be inspected right away.
 *    - The device state is unchanged, and the error can be handled without waiting for any further device activity.
 *    - Example: cudaMalloc fails because the requested memory size is too large or the device is out of memory.
 *      The call to cudaMalloc returns cudaErrorMemoryAllocation (or a related error code) and the pointer remains unchanged.
 *
 * 2. Asynchronous errors
 *    - These errors occur during device execution after an API call has returned.
 *    - The kernel launch, memory copy, or any other queued command is asynchronous relative to the host.
 *    - The API call itself may return cudaSuccess because the command was successfully queued.
 *    - The error will only be reported when a subsequent CUDA API call that performs a device synchronization
 *      (e.g., cudaDeviceSynchronize, cudaMemcpy, cudaGetLastError, cudaPeekAtLastError, or even program exit) is executed.
 *    - Example: launching a kernel with a launch configuration that exceeds the deviceâ€™s limits (e.g., too many blocks or too many threads per block).
 *      The launch call returns cudaSuccess, but the kernel fails and the error is reported later during synchronization.
 *
 * How to detect each type:
 *    - Synchronous: Check the return value of the CUDA API call immediately.
 *    - Asynchronous: Call cudaGetLastError() after the kernel launch or after any CUDA call that synchronizes the device.
 *
 * Practical implications:
 *    - For synchronous errors, you can recover immediately (e.g., try a smaller allocation).
 *    - For asynchronous errors, you need to ensure that the error is checked after the device has completed its work.
 *
 * This program demonstrates both types of errors in a minimal example:
 *    - It attempts to allocate an excessively large amount of memory to trigger a synchronous cudaMalloc failure.
 *    - It launches a kernel with a launch configuration that exceeds device limits to trigger an asynchronous launch failure.
 *
 * The program prints the error messages for both cases, illustrating how they differ in timing and detection.
 *
 * Entire thinking process:
 *    1. Decide to illustrate both error types with a single .cu file.
 *    2. Include a kernel that does nothing but allows a launch with configurable grid/block dimensions.
 *    3. In main, first attempt a large cudaMalloc to trigger synchronous error; check return value immediately.
 *    4. Next, launch the kernel with grid dimensions that exceed device capabilities (e.g., too many blocks).
 *    5. Immediately after launch, check cudaGetLastError (which should return cudaSuccess because launch is queued).
 *    6. Then call cudaDeviceSynchronize to force device completion and capture the asynchronous error.
 *    7. Print both errors, demonstrating the difference.
 *    8. Keep the code minimal, compile with nvcc, and ensure it compiles on any CUDA-capable device.
