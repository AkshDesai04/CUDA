```cpp
/*
Aim of the program:
Write a helper function `void launch_empty_kernel()` that contains the kernel launch call.

Thinking process:
1. The request is to provide a helper function that launches an empty CUDA kernel.
2. We need a minimal kernel definition (`__global__ void empty_kernel() {}`) that does nothing.
3. The helper function `launch_empty_kernel()` should perform the kernel launch with a simple launch configuration,
   such as a single block and a single thread: `empty_kernel<<<1, 1>>>();`.
4. It's good practice to synchronize and check for launch errors, so we will add `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` and
   basic error handling using `cudaGetLastError()`.
5. To make the file selfâ€‘contained, we include a `main()` that calls `launch_empty_kernel()`. This allows the
   program to be compiled and run to verify that the kernel launch works.
6. We include the necessary CUDA headers and use `#include <stdio.h>` for error printing.
7. The code will be placed in a single .cu file with the requested helper function defined and used.
8. No additional features or libraries are added, keeping the code as simple as possible while demonstrating
   the required kernel launch.
