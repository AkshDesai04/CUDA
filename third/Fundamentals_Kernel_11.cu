```cuda
/*
Pass a pointer to a struct to a kernel. The host should allocate the struct on both host and device. Initialize it on the host, copy to device. The kernel should modify a member of the struct. The host should copy it back and verify the modification.

Thinking:
1. Define a simple struct with multiple data types to demonstrate pointer manipulation.
2. Allocate a single instance of this struct on the host and initialize its members.
3. Allocate device memory for a struct pointer using cudaMalloc.
4. Copy the initialized struct from host to device using cudaMemcpy.
5. Write a kernel that receives a pointer to the struct and modifies at least one member (int, float, and a string).
6. Launch the kernel with one thread (since we only have one struct instance).
7. Copy the struct back from device to host.
8. Print the struct members before and after kernel execution to verify the modification.
9. Add basic error checking after CUDA API calls and kernel launch.
10. Free allocated device memory and host memory before exiting.

This code demonstrates pointer-to-struct passing, memory management between host and device, and verification of modifications made on the device.
