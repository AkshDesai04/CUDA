Does this change affect the original struct on the host? Explain why or why not (pass-by-value).`\n\n""" \nThe kernel receives its arguments by value, meaning that the data is copied from host memory into a local variable on the device. \nWhen the kernel modifies that local copy (for example, setting a member field to a new value), the changes only affect the copy in the\ndevice\'s local memory; they do not propagate back to the host memory where the original struct resides. \nTherefore, after the kernel finishes, the original struct on the host remains unchanged. \nThis demonstrates the pass‑by‑value semantics of kernel arguments in CUDA: any modification inside the kernel is local to the device \nand does not affect the host\'s copy. The following CUDA C program shows this behavior by printing the struct values before and after a \nkernel launch that attempts to modify the struct\'s members.\n"""\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\ntypedef struct {\n    int a;\n    float b;\n} MyStruct;\n\n// Kernel that receives a struct by value and modifies its members\n__global__ void modifyStruct(MyStruct s) {\n    // Modify the local copy\n    s.a = 42;\n    s.b = 3.14f;\n    // Print from the device to show the modified values\n    printf("Inside kernel: s.a = %d, s.b = %f\\n", s.a, s.b);\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    // Host struct initialization\n    MyStruct hostStruct;\n    hostStruct.a = 1;\n    hostStruct.b = 2.0f;\n\n    printf("Before kernel launch: hostStruct.a = %d, hostStruct.b = %f\\n",\n           hostStruct.a, hostStruct.b);\n\n    // Launch kernel with the struct passed by value\n    modifyStruct<<<1, 1>>>(hostStruct);\n\n    // Wait for GPU to finish\n    cudaDeviceSynchronize();\n\n    printf("After kernel launch: hostStruct.a = %d, hostStruct.b = %f\\n",\n           hostStruct.a, hostStruct.b);\n\n    // Clean up and exit\n    cudaDeviceReset();\n    return 0;\n}\n', images=None, tool_calls=None)
