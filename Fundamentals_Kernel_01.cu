```c
/*
Write a 'Hello World' CUDA program. The kernel should be launched with a single block containing a single thread. The host code (the `main` function) should print 'Kernel launched successfully!' after the kernel launch. The kernel itself will be empty.

My thinking:
- The program is a minimal CUDA example. 
- The kernel is intentionally empty; its purpose is just to demonstrate launching.
- I will define a __global__ void helloKernel() {} with no content.
- The main function will launch the kernel with <<<1,1>>> configuration.
- Immediately after the launch I will print the success message using printf.
- Optionally, to ensure the kernel actually runs before we exit, I could call cudaDeviceSynchronize(), but the spec doesn't require it; however it is good practice.
- Error checking: I will check cudaGetLastError after the launch and before printing, so that if the launch failed, we can print an error message instead. 
- The code will include <cstdio> for printf and <cuda_runtime.h> for CUDA runtime API.
*/

#include <cstdio>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void helloKernel() {
    // Empty kernel
}

int main() {
    // Launch kernel with one block and one thread
    helloKernel<<<1, 1>>>();

    // Check for launch errors
    cudaError_t err = cudaGetLastError();
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        printf("Kernel launch failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
        return 1;
    }

    // Optionally synchronize to ensure kernel completion
    cudaDeviceSynchronize();

    // Print success message
    printf("Kernel launched successfully!\n");

    return 0;
}
