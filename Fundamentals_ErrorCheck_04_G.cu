/*
Aim of the program:
Does this error occur synchronously or asynchronously?

Thinking:
In CUDA, many operations are asynchronous with respect to the host. 
Kernel launches are asynchronous â€“ the launch returns immediately and the 
kernel executes on the device concurrently. If a kernel causes an error 
(e.g., accessing memory out of bounds), the error is not reported to the 
host until a synchronous operation such as cudaGetLastError() or 
cudaDeviceSynchronize() is called. These functions perform a device-to-host 
synchronization, blocking the host until the device completes its work, and 
then they return the status of any errors that occurred during the device 
execution. Thus, the error itself is detected asynchronously, but the host 
side error reporting is synchronous. This program demonstrates that by 
launching a kernel that performs an out-of-bounds write, then checking the
error immediately (synchronously) after the launch and also after a 
synchronization point. The program prints whether an error was found in each
step, illustrating the difference between asynchronous kernel execution
and synchronous error retrieval.
