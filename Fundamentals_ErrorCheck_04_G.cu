Aim of the program: 
Does this error occur synchronously or asynchronously?

Thinking:
The user is asking whether a particular error occurs synchronously or asynchronously. 
In CUDA, many API errors can be either synchronous (reported immediately) or asynchronous 
(pending until a synchronization point). To demonstrate this distinction, we will create 
a simple CUDA program that intentionally causes an out‑of‑bounds memory access in a 
kernel. The kernel launch is asynchronous with respect to the host; the runtime will
not immediately report the error when the kernel is launched. The error will only be
retrieved after the device has performed the operation, typically after a call to
cudaDeviceSynchronize() or a subsequent API call that forces synchronization. 

We will:
1. Allocate a small array on the device.
2. Launch a kernel that writes beyond the bounds of the array.
3. Call cudaGetLastError() immediately after the kernel launch to check for
   synchronous errors. This will normally report no error because the kernel
   execution is still pending.
4. Call cudaDeviceSynchronize() to force the host to wait for the kernel to finish.
   At this point, cudaDeviceSynchronize() will return an error indicating the
   out‑of‑bounds access.
5. Print the error messages from both checks to show the difference.

This program thus serves to illustrate that the out‑of‑bounds error is asynchronous
with respect to the host until a synchronization point is reached.
