```cuda
/*
Aim of the program: Use `sizeof()` on the host and device to print the size of the struct and verify they are the same.

Thoughts:
1. Define a simple struct with a few members of different types.
2. On the host, use `sizeof(MyStruct)` and print it using std::cout.
3. On the device, create a kernel that prints `sizeof(MyStruct)` using device `printf`. 
   This requires a compute capability of at least 2.0, so the code should be compiled
   with an appropriate architecture flag (e.g. -arch=sm_20).
4. Launch the kernel from the host, then synchronize and exit.
5. No dynamic memory or complex error handling is needed; the focus is on demonstrating
   that `sizeof()` returns the same value on both host and device.
6. The program will be selfâ€‘contained in a single .cu file, with all includes and
   using statements necessary for compilation.
