`cudaMemcpy` is the function that actually moves data between the **host (CPU) memory** and the **device (GPU) memory**.  
Because the host and device have separate address spaces, the CUDA runtime cannot simply dereference a pointer that points to GPU memory from CPU code (or vice‑versa). Instead, it has to perform an explicit copy that understands the underlying memory bus (PCI‑e, NVLink, etc.) and the required direction.

The function takes four arguments:

```c
cudaMemcpy(void* dst, const void* src, size_t count, cudaMemcpyKind kind);
```

* `dst` – destination pointer (on host or device).  
* `src` – source pointer (on host or device).  
* `count` – number of bytes to transfer.  
* `kind` – an enum (`cudaMemcpyHostToDevice`, `cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost`, `cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice`, or `cudaMemcpyDefault`) that tells CUDA which memory spaces the source and destination belong to.

**How it bridges the gap**

1. **Runtime awareness** – The runtime knows whether each pointer is in host or device memory. If the pointer is an ordinary CPU pointer, it’s treated as host memory; if it’s a pointer obtained via `cudaMalloc`, it’s treated as device memory.

2. **Bus access** – Depending on the `kind`, CUDA issues the appropriate bus transaction.  
   * *Host → Device* – data is sent over the PCI‑e bus (or NVLink) from the CPU to the GPU’s memory controller.  
   * *Device → Host* – data is sent back the other way.  
   * *Device → Device* – on systems with multiple GPUs, a peer‑to‑peer copy is performed.  

3. **Synchronization** – `cudaMemcpy` is **blocking**; it waits until the transfer completes before returning control to the caller. This guarantees that after the call returns, the destination memory contains the correct data. For non‑blocking copies, one can use streams and `cudaMemcpyAsync`.

4. **Coherence** – By performing an explicit copy, the function provides a well‑defined point where host and device memories are consistent. Without such a mechanism, the two address spaces would remain completely isolated, and the programmer would have no way to move data between them.

In short, `cudaMemcpy` is the API gateway that translates a high‑level “copy X bytes from this pointer to that pointer” request into the low‑level bus transactions required to shuttle data between the CPU’s RAM and the GPU’s VRAM, thereby allowing algorithms that span both host and device to cooperate correctly.
