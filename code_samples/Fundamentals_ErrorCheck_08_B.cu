/*
Aim: In the version with error checking, use your CHECK macro to catch and report the cudaErrorIllegalAddress.
 
My thinking:
The requirement is to build a minimal CUDA program that intentionally triggers an illegal memory access (cudaErrorIllegalAddress) and uses a custom error checking macro to capture and report the error.  
To do this I will:

1. Define a `CHECK` macro that wraps a function `gpuAssert`.  `gpuAssert` will examine the CUDA error code, print a detailed message if the code is not `cudaSuccess`, and optionally abort execution.  
2. Allocate a small array on the device.  
3. Launch a kernel that writes past the bounds of this array.  A single thread will write to an index that is out of range, which should cause `cudaErrorIllegalAddress`.  
4. Immediately after launching the kernel I will call `CHECK(cudaGetLastError());` â€“ this forces the runtime to report any launch-time errors, including the illegal address.  
5. I will also call `CHECK(cudaDeviceSynchronize());` so that any deferred errors (like the illegal address that can surface at sync time) are also caught.  

The program will print the error message produced by `gpuAssert` and then exit gracefully.  The code is a complete `.cu` file that can be compiled with `nvcc`.
