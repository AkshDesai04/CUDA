/*
Aim: Can you stop a hanging kernel from the host code without resetting the device? (Generally no).

Thinking:
- The purpose of this program is to demonstrate that a CUDA kernel that runs indefinitely
  cannot be stopped from the host side without resetting the device.  CUDA does not
  expose any API to kill a running kernel; the only mechanism for recovery is a
  device reset, which destroys all context state.
- We will write a very small kernel that loops forever (`while(true) {}`).
- The host will launch this kernel and then attempt to synchronize with it using
  `cudaDeviceSynchronize()`.  Because the kernel never terminates, the
  synchronization call will block forever, illustrating that the host cannot
  stop the kernel.
- An attempt to call `cudaDeviceReset()` while the kernel is running would also
  block indefinitely for the same reason.  Hence, the only way to recover from a
  hung kernel is to reset the device (which is a heavy operation).
- This example is for demonstration only and should be run with care, as it will
  hang the program indefinitely.
