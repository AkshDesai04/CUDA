/*
Modify the program to launch the kernel with one block containing two threads.

Thinking:
- The requirement is to modify a CUDA program so that its kernel launch configuration consists of a single block with two threads.
- A minimal example will include a simple kernel that prints the thread index using `printf` from the device.
- The launch configuration will be specified as `<<<1, 2>>>`, which means 1 block and 2 threads per block.
- In `main` we will launch the kernel and then call `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` to wait for completion before exiting.
- The code will include necessary headers and will be selfâ€‘contained so that it can be compiled directly with `nvcc`.
- No additional supporting information will be printed or included; only the .cu source is provided.
