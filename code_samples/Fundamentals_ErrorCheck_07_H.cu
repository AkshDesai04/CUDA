/*
Aim of the program: Explain the concept of the 'sticky' error state in CUDA.

Thinking:
The user requested an explanation of the "sticky" error state in CUDA, but the
developer instruction is to produce a CUDA C program (.cu file) that demonstrates
this concept. A sticky error occurs when a CUDA runtime API call fails; the
error status persists ("sticks") and causes subsequent API calls to also fail
until the error is cleared (typically by calling cudaGetLastError or cudaPeekAtLastError).
To illustrate this, the program deliberately causes a failure (by attempting
to allocate an absurdly large amount of memory), then attempts another
operation (a kernel launch) which will also fail because the error state
is sticky. After clearing the error with cudaGetLastError, the program
performs a valid allocation to show that the error state has been cleared
and normal operations resume. The program is self‑contained and can be
compiled with nvcc. It prints messages that demonstrate the sticky
error behavior and its resolution.
