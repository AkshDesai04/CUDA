```cpp
/*
Aim of the program:
Modify the program to print 'Hello from host!' before the kernel launch and 'Kernel finished!' after the kernel launch.

Thinking:
- The task is to produce a CUDA C++ (.cu) file that performs the following:
- 1. Prints a message from the host ("Hello from host!") before launching a kernel.
- 2. Launches a simple kernel that optionally prints a message from the device.
- 3. After the kernel finishes executing, prints another message from the host ("Kernel finished!").
- The kernel can be a minimal example (e.g., a single-thread block doing nothing or printing a message).
- Error handling should be included to catch CUDA runtime errors.
- The program must compile with nvcc and run on a system with a CUDA-capable GPU.
- The comment block at the top must contain the exact aim string and the explanation of reasoning.

Implementation details:
- Use <stdio.h> for printf.
- Use <cuda_runtime.h> for CUDA API.
- Define a __global__ kernel that prints "Hello from kernel!" (optional).
- In main():
  - Print host message before kernel launch.
  - Launch kernel<<<1,1>>>(); (one block, one thread).
  - Use cudaGetLastError() to check kernel launch.
  - Use cudaDeviceSynchronize() to wait for kernel completion.
  - Print host message after kernel finished.
  - Check for errors after synchronization.
  - Return 0.

This yields a complete, selfâ€‘contained CUDA program that satisfies the requirement.
