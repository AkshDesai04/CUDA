/*
The maximum number of threads that can be launched in a single CUDA block is limited by the GPU’s hardware resources and architecture.  
The main reasons for this limit are:

1. **Warp scheduling and the SIMD nature of SMs**  
   Each Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) schedules work in groups of 32 threads called warps.  
   The SM can only manage a fixed number of active warps simultaneously (typically 32 or 64).  
   If a block contains more threads than can be accommodated by the available warps, the SM must split the block into multiple “grids of warps” that execute sequentially, which reduces parallelism and increases latency.

2. **Resource per thread**  
   Every thread consumes registers, local memory, and (implicitly) a share of the SM’s shared memory.  
   The SM has a finite amount of registers and shared memory.  
   If each thread requests many registers or a large amount of shared memory, the number of threads that can fit in an SM is reduced.  
   The CUDA runtime uses a per‑SM resource table to determine the maximum block size that will allow at least one active thread block per SM.

3. **Occupancy constraints**  
   Occupancy is the ratio of active warps to the maximum number of warps an SM can support.  
   High occupancy is generally desirable for hiding memory latency.  
   If a block is too large, fewer blocks can reside on the same SM, which can lower occupancy and lead to underutilization of the GPU.

4. **Hardware limits**  
   The architecture itself imposes hard limits.  
   For example, on NVIDIA GPUs of the Volta/ampere architecture the maximum threads per block is 1024.  
   These limits are determined by the width of the warp scheduler, the size of the warp registers, the maximum number of warps that can be stored in the instruction issue queue, and other design constraints that cannot be exceeded without changing the hardware.

5. **Warp divergence and scheduling overhead**  
   Larger blocks increase the chance of warp divergence (threads following different execution paths) which can hurt performance.  
   Smaller blocks allow the scheduler to retire warps more quickly and to handle divergence more efficiently.

In practice, the limit is a compromise between the desire for fine‑grained parallelism (more threads per block) and the need to keep enough resources per thread and per warp so that the GPU can run many blocks concurrently while maintaining high occupancy and low latency. The CUDA runtime automatically calculates the maximum allowed block size based on the kernel’s resource usage and the device’s capability, and the programmer can query or set it accordingly.
