```cuda
/* 
Aim of the program (exactly as requested):
Define a kernel that takes an `int*` argument, but try to launch it without providing any arguments.

Thought process:
1. We want to demonstrate that a kernel launch must match the kernel's signature.
2. The kernel will accept a single pointer argument, e.g., `int* data`.
3. In the host code we attempt to launch the kernel with no arguments: `kernel<<<1,1>>>();`.
4. This mismatch should trigger a compile‑time error ("too few arguments to function call").
5. To make the program self‑contained, we include minimal error checking for the launch
   (though the launch itself will not compile).
6. The code is written in CUDA C and stored in a .cu file. 
7. Since the launch is syntactically wrong, the compiler will flag the error and
   the program will not produce a working binary, which is the intended behavior.
