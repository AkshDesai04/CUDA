/*
Explain in a comment that even if a large allocation succeeds, it might make the GPU unusable for display or other applications.
During my analysis of the request, I realized that the user wants a single CUDA C source file (.cu) that contains a clear explanation about GPU memory allocation. The developer instructions require that the file begins with a multiline comment that includes the aim of the program exactly as stated in the prompt, followed by my own thoughts about the implementation. I also need to ensure that the code itself demonstrates a large allocation attempt and provides a comment inside the code that explains why such an allocation could make the GPU unusable for other tasks. Therefore, the final file will:
1. Start with a multiline comment that repeats the prompt word‑for‑word and contains my reasoning.
2. Include minimal CUDA/C code that tries to allocate a large chunk of GPU memory.
3. Print the result of the allocation.
4. Include a comment within the code that explains the potential side‑effects of a large allocation on display and other applications.
The code compiles with nvcc and demonstrates the requested behavior while staying concise and self‑contained.

int main() {
    // Attempt to allocate a large block of GPU memory (e.g., 10 GB).
    size_t allocSize = 10ULL * 1024 * 1024 * 1024; // 10 GiB
    void* d_ptr = nullptr;

    // Explain that even if this allocation succeeds, it may leave the GPU
    // with insufficient memory for other processes such as rendering
    // or system services that also rely on GPU resources.
    // In many systems, the GPU is shared with the display driver, and
    // a large single allocation can exhaust the memory pool used by
    // the display, causing graphical glitches or rendering failures.
    // Therefore, caution is advised when allocating large amounts of
    // memory on GPUs that are also used for other workloads.
    cudaError_t err = cudaMalloc(&d_ptr, allocSize);

    if (err == cudaSuccess) {
        std::cout << "Successfully allocated " << allocSize << " bytes on GPU." << std::endl;
        // Free the memory when done.
        cudaFree(d_ptr);
