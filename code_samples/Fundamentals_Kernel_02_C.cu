/*
Aim: Modify the printf to include the thread's ID: printf("Hello from thread %d!\n", threadIdx.x);. Launch with 8 threads.

Thinking:
The user wants a simple CUDA program that demonstrates how to print the thread ID from within a kernel. 
To accomplish this, we will write a __global__ kernel that uses device printf. 
We will launch the kernel with one block of 8 threads so that threadIdx.x ranges from 0 to 7. 
The kernel body will simply call printf("Hello from thread %d!\n", threadIdx.x); 
We will then synchronize the device in the host code to ensure all output is flushed before the program exits. 
Additionally, we will check for any CUDA errors after the kernel launch and after synchronization. 
The program will be selfâ€‘contained and can be compiled with nvcc.

#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void helloKernel() {
    printf("Hello from thread %d!\n", threadIdx.x);
}

int main() {
    // Launch kernel with 1 block of 8 threads
    helloKernel<<<1, 8>>>();

    // Check for kernel launch errors
    cudaError_t err = cudaGetLastError();
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Kernel launch failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
        return 1;
    }

    // Synchronize to ensure all printf output is flushed
    err = cudaDeviceSynchronize();
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Device synchronization failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
