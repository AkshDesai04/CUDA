**Pros of using exceptions (C++ exceptions) for error handling in CUDA:**

1. **Clear separation of error handling logic** – Exceptions allow you to separate normal code flow from error handling, making the code cleaner.
2. **Automatic unwinding** – Stack unwinding automatically cleans up local objects, which can help avoid leaks or corrupted state.
3. **Rich error information** – You can pass detailed error objects (including error codes, messages, stack traces, etc.) which can be inspected by callers.
4. **Composability** – Functions can throw without caring about the downstream handling; higher‑level code decides what to do.
5. **Consistent with C++** – Many CUDA C++ libraries (e.g., Thrust, cuBLAS wrappers) already use exceptions, so using them keeps a consistent style.

**Cons of using exceptions in CUDA:**

1. **Limited CUDA runtime support** – The CUDA runtime and device code do **not** support throwing C++ exceptions. Any exception that originates on the GPU device side will result in a crash or undefined behavior.
2. **Kernel entry/exit restrictions** – You cannot catch exceptions that occur in a kernel or from device code; they must be handled via return codes or `cudaError_t`.
3. **Overhead on the host** – Throwing and catching exceptions can add runtime overhead, especially if many errors occur during large-scale parallel work.
4. **Complexity with mixed host/device code** – When host code calls device functions that may fail, you have to translate device error codes into host exceptions manually, increasing boilerplate.
5. **Potential for inconsistent error propagation** – If some parts of the code use exceptions and others use error codes, it can be confusing to maintain a unified error‑handling strategy.

**Pros of using `exit()` (or `cudaDeviceReset()/exit()` style error handling):**

1. **Simplicity** – A single call terminates the program immediately, no need for try/catch blocks.
2. **No need for exception support** – Works fine with both host and device code; you can check CUDA API return codes and exit on failure.
3. **Predictable behavior** – The program ends deterministically, which can be useful in quick prototypes or when debugging.
4. **Low overhead** – No exception machinery is invoked; the overhead is negligible.
5. **Compatibility** – Works on any compiler, any CUDA version, and with legacy C code.

**Cons of using `exit()` (or similar immediate termination):**

1. **Loss of cleanup** – Destructors for stack objects, RAII resources, or CUDA memory may not run, potentially leaving dangling GPU memory or other resources.
2. **No context** – The program stops abruptly; you cannot provide context or propagate error information to higher levels (e.g., log files, error handlers).
3. **Harder to recover** – If you want to recover from certain errors (e.g., retry a kernel, reinitialize a stream), `exit()` makes that impossible.
4. **Testing difficulties** – Unit tests or integration tests often require graceful failure handling; `exit()` kills the process, making it hard to test error paths.
5. **Not suitable for libraries** – If your code is part of a library used by other programs, calling `exit()` is unacceptable; it should signal errors via return codes or exceptions.

### Typical CUDA error‑handling pattern

```cpp
// Host helper macro to check CUDA errors
#define CUDA_CHECK(call)                                         \
  do {                                                           \
    cudaError_t err = (call);                                    \
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {                                    \
      fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error in %s:%d : %s\n",              \
              __FILE__, __LINE__, cudaGetErrorString(err));      \
      exit(EXIT_FAILURE); /* or throw std::runtime_error(...) */ \
    }                                                            \
  } while (0)
```

- On the host side you can choose to `exit()` or throw an exception.
- On the device side you **must** use return codes (`cudaError_t`) and check them after kernel launches (`cudaGetLastError()`).

**Bottom line**

- **Use exceptions** for **host‑side** logic when you need rich error propagation and cleanup, but translate device errors into exceptions carefully.
- **Use `exit()`** (or return codes) for **device‑side** error handling or when you need a quick, deterministic failure mechanism.  
- A hybrid approach—return codes from CUDA APIs, check them with a macro, then throw exceptions on the host—often provides the best balance.
