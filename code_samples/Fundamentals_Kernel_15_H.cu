```c
/*
Aim of the program (word for word as requested):
"Write a kernel with an infinite loop where only thread 0 loops forever. The other threads finish. Does the block as a whole ever finish? (No, requires all threads to finish)."

Thinking:
1. The task is to demonstrate that if any thread in a block enters an infinite loop,
   the entire block cannot finish execution because CUDA requires that all threads
   in a block terminate before the kernel can return control to the host.
2. The kernel will be written with a simple branching:
   - Thread 0 executes a while(true) loop that never exits.
   - All other threads perform a trivial work (e.g., increment a counter) and then exit.
3. The host code will launch a single block with several threads.
4. After launching the kernel, we will call cudaDeviceSynchronize() to force the
   host to wait for kernel completion. Because thread 0 never exits, this call
   will block forever, illustrating that the block does not finish.
5. For completeness and good practice, the code includes error checking for
   CUDA API calls. The program will compile and run, but it will hang when
   executed due to the infinite loop in thread 0.
6. Comments in the code explain the logic and the expected behavior.
