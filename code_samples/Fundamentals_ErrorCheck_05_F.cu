```c
/*
What happens if you have 0 CUDA devices and you try to `cudaSetDevice(0)`?
This program demonstrates the behavior when attempting to set a CUDA device
in an environment where no CUDA-capable devices are present. The logic is
as follows:

1. Query the number of CUDA devices using `cudaGetDeviceCount`. 
   - If the count is zero, the program prints a message indicating that
     there are no devices available.
2. Regardless of the device count, the program attempts to call
   `cudaSetDevice(0)` to mimic the scenario described in the question.
3. The return status of `cudaSetDevice` is captured. If an error occurs
   (which is expected when there are zero devices), the program prints
   the CUDA error code and its string representation.
4. Finally, the program exits, returning an exit code that reflects
   whether `cudaSetDevice` succeeded (0) or failed (non-zero).

The expectation is that `cudaSetDevice(0)` will return an error code such
as `cudaErrorNoDevice` when there are no CUDA devices available, and
this program will output that error information for verification.
