Explain in a comment where the CUDA driver is typically installed (e.g., as part of the NVIDIA display driver) and where the CUDA runtime is installed (e.g., with the CUDA Toolkit).

The CUDA driver is a low‑level component that sits below the operating system's display driver stack. On Windows, the driver binary is usually installed as part of the NVIDIA GeForce / Quadro / Tesla driver package, which is delivered via the NVIDIA Graphics Driver installer. The driver files reside in system directories such as `C:\Windows\System32\` or `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\` (for 32‑bit components) and may also be present in `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\NVDisplayDriver\`. On Linux, the driver binaries are typically loaded from kernel modules located in `/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/graphics/` or via the `nvidia` kernel module, and the user‑space components (like `libnvidia-ogl.so`) are installed under `/usr/lib/` or `/usr/lib64/`.

The CUDA runtime is part of the CUDA Toolkit, which provides high‑level API headers and libraries (e.g., `libcudart.so`, `cudart64_XX.dll`) for application developers. On Windows, the Toolkit installation directory is usually `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\vX.Y\`, containing subfolders like `bin`, `include`, `lib`, etc. On Linux, the Toolkit is commonly installed under `/usr/local/cuda-XX.Y/` (or a custom prefix), with `include`, `lib64`, `bin` subdirectories. The runtime libraries are linked at compile time or runtime by setting appropriate library search paths (e.g., `-lcudart` for gcc or adding `CUDAROOT/lib` to LD_LIBRARY_PATH). This separation allows applications to compile against the CUDA Runtime API while the driver handles direct communication with the GPU hardware.

The key distinction: the driver is installed as part of the system's graphics driver stack and handles low‑level GPU management, whereas the runtime is installed with the CUDA Toolkit and provides a user‑friendly API for developers to write CUDA applications.
