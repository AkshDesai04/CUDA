Aim: Explain in a comment why GPUs excel at this type of 'embarrassingly parallel' problem.

Embarrassingly parallel problems are those in which a large amount of independent work can be
performed simultaneously with virtually no need for communication or synchronization between
the units of work. GPUs are specifically engineered to handle this kind of workload for several
reasons:

1. Massive Parallelism:
   - Modern GPUs contain thousands of small, efficient cores (CUDA cores for NVIDIA GPUs) that
     can execute many threads in parallel. This hardware parallelism is orders of magnitude
     greater than what a typical CPU offers.

2. SIMT Execution Model:
   - GPUs use a Single Instruction, Multiple Threads (SIMT) model where a warp (32 threads on
     NVIDIA hardware) executes the same instruction concurrently. For embarrassingly parallel
     tasks, each thread performs an identical operation on a different data element, which
     maps naturally to SIMT execution and yields high throughput.

3. High Memory Bandwidth:
   - GPUs provide extremely high memory bandwidth and specialized memory hierarchies
     (shared memory, L1/L2 caches, and texture memory). When each thread works on
     independent data, the high bandwidth allows all threads to fetch and write data
      rapidly, minimizing memory bottlenecks.

4. Low Overhead of Thread Management:
   - GPUs can launch and schedule thousands of threads with very little overhead. For
     embarrassingly parallel problems, thread creation and synchronization costs are
     negligible relative to the work performed.

5. Energy Efficiency per FLOP:
   - Because a GPU spends most of its cycles performing arithmetic rather than
     waiting on memory or control flow, it achieves higher energy efficiency per
     floating‑point operation, making it attractive for large‑scale parallel workloads.

6. Dedicated Compiler and Runtime Optimizations:
   - CUDA compilers optimize memory access patterns, instruction scheduling, and
     occupancy to maximize the usage of the GPU’s execution resources for independent
     thread work.

In summary, the combination of thousands of lightweight cores, SIMD execution, massive
memory bandwidth, low thread‑management overhead, and compiler/runtime optimizations makes
GPUs exceptionally well suited for embarrassingly parallel tasks, where each unit of work
can proceed independently without contention or communication.
