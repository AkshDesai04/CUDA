/*
Aim of the program:
Create a `__device__` function that takes the struct as an argument by value.

Thinking:
To satisfy the requirement I first define a simple struct `MyStruct` containing two members (an `int` and a `float`) to demonstrate that a struct can be passed by value to a device function.  
The device function `myDeviceFunc` receives an instance of `MyStruct` by value, and for visibility it prints the contents of the struct using `printf`.  Printing is allowed in device code for devices of compute capability >= 2.0, which is commonly supported.

I then create a kernel `kernel` that accepts a `MyStruct` parameter (also by value) and calls `myDeviceFunc`.  
In `main` I allocate and initialize a `MyStruct` instance on the host, launch the kernel with one thread, and synchronize. The program uses standard CUDA runtime API calls: `cudaMallocManaged` for unified memory (easier to pass struct to kernel), `cudaDeviceSynchronize`, and error checking. The kernel launch configuration is a single block of a single thread as the purpose is to demonstrate passing by value, not parallelism.

The program is selfâ€‘contained, includes all necessary headers, and compiles with `nvcc`.
