```cpp
/*
Aim of the program (word for word):
Write a simple __global__ function (a kernel) that does nothing. In your main function, attempt to compile this file using the NVIDIA CUDA Compiler (NVCC) command line, for example: nvcc my_program.cu -o my_program. Run the resulting executable.

Thinking:
The goal is to demonstrate a minimal CUDA kernel that performs no operations, then show how a host program can invoke the CUDA compiler (nvcc) to compile itself, and finally execute the compiled binary. Directly compiling the same source file from within its own main() would cause infinite recursion: each time the binary is run, it would compile again. To avoid this, we use a command line flag ("run") to distinguish between the "compile" mode and the "run" mode. In compile mode (no flag), the program calls the shell to execute `nvcc my_program.cu -o my_program`. After successful compilation, it invokes the newly created executable with the "run" flag. In run mode, the program simply launches the dummy kernel and synchronizes the device. This approach keeps the program self-contained while illustrating the compile‑and‑run workflow. Error handling is minimal: we print status messages and return non‑zero on failure. The code relies on the standard C++ library and the CUDA runtime API.
