/*
Aim of the program:
Choose a block size of 256 threads. Calculate the required grid size for a vector of 1,048,576 elements.

Thinking:
The grid size (number of thread blocks) needed to process a vector of size N with a block size of B
is given by the ceiling of N/B, which can be computed as (N + B - 1) / B using integer arithmetic.
Here, N = 1,048,576 and B = 256. Since 1,048,576 is exactly divisible by 256 (1,048,576 / 256 = 4,096),
the grid size will be 4,096. The program will define these constants, calculate the grid size,
and print the result. It also demonstrates how one would launch a simple kernel with these
dimensions, although the kernel here performs no useful work.

#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// Simple kernel placeholder (does nothing)
__global__ void dummyKernel(float *d_vec) {
    // No operation; just a placeholder
}

int main() {
    const int N = 1048576;           // Size of the vector
    const int BLOCK_SIZE = 256;      // Number of threads per block

    // Compute grid size (number of blocks)
    int gridSize = (N + BLOCK_SIZE - 1) / BLOCK_SIZE;

    std::cout << "Vector size: " << N << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Block size (threads per block): " << BLOCK_SIZE << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Calculated grid size (number of blocks): " << gridSize << std::endl;

    // Allocate memory on device (optional, just for demonstration)
    float *d_vec = nullptr;
    cudaMalloc(&d_vec, N * sizeof(float));

    // Launch dummy kernel (optional)
    dummyKernel<<<gridSize, BLOCK_SIZE>>>(d_vec);

    // Synchronize to ensure kernel completion
    cudaDeviceSynchronize();

    // Free device memory
    cudaFree(d_vec);
