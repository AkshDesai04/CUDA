/*
If a kernel uses 64 registers per thread and the max threads per block is 1024, calculate the total registers required by a full block. Compare this to the max registers per block to see if such a launch is possible.

Thinking:
- Each thread consumes 64 registers.
- A block can have at most 1024 threads.
- Total registers per full block = 64 * 1024 = 65536.
- The maximum registers available per block on most modern NVIDIA GPUs is typically 65536 (though this can vary by architecture; some GPUs allow up to 65536 registers per SM and thus per block if occupancy allows).
- Therefore, a block that uses 65536 registers will exactly match the hardware limit and is technically possible, but any additional register usage or higher thread count would exceed the limit and would not be allowed.
- In the program below we compute these values and report whether the launch is possible.
