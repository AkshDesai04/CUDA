/*
What happens to the value of a `__device__` variable when the application exits?
When a CUDA application terminates, all device memory allocated by the runtime
is released. A `__device__` variable resides in that device memory, so its
contents are destroyed along with the rest of the allocation. Therefore, the
value of a `__device__` variable is **not** preserved across program runs.
Inside a single program execution, the variable persists across kernel
invocations, but once the process ends, the device memory is freed and the
value is lost. The next run starts with the variable initialized to its
declaration value again.

This program demonstrates:
1. A `__device__` variable `devCounter` that is initialized to 0.
2. A kernel that increments `devCounter`.
3. Host code that launches the kernel, reads back the value, and prints it.
4. The fact that after the program exits, the variable does not retain its
   value â€“ the next execution (if run again) will start from 0.
