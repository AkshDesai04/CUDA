/*
If a kernel requires 16KB of shared memory, calculate the maximum number of threads you can launch in a block if the device limit is 48KB per block and 1024 threads (assuming no other constraints).

Thinking:
- Each block requires 16KB of shared memory.
- The device allows up to 48KB of shared memory per block.
- The shared memory usage does not exceed the device limit per block (16KB < 48KB), so shared memory is not a limiting factor.
- The other given constraint is the maximum number of threads per block, which is 1024.
- Therefore, the maximum number of threads you can launch in a block is 1024, since the shared memory requirement does not restrict the number of threads beyond this limit.
