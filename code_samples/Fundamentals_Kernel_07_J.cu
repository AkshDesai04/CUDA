```cuda
/*
Aim of the program: Pass an integer offset `d`. Have threads print `(threadIdx.x + d, threadIdx.y + d)`.

Thinking:
- We need a CUDA program that accepts an integer offset `d` and spawns a grid of threads.
- Each thread will print its own (x, y) coordinates shifted by the offset `d`.
- We'll use the built‑in `printf` support in CUDA device code, which requires a compute capability of at least 2.0.
- For simplicity, we'll set a block size of 16x16 and launch a single block; this keeps the number of printed lines manageable.
- The offset `d` will be passed from the host to the kernel via a kernel argument.
- We'll allow the user to specify `d` via a command‑line argument; if none is provided, we default to `0`.
- The kernel signature will be: `__global__ void offsetKernel(int d)`.
- Inside the kernel, each thread will compute `int x = threadIdx.x + d; int y = threadIdx.y + d;` and call `printf`.
- After kernel launch, we call `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` to ensure all output is flushed.
- Basic error checking will be performed for CUDA API calls.

Note: Printing from many CUDA threads can produce interleaved output; for large grids this may become unreadable. This example uses a small block to keep output clear.
