/*
Aim: After printing the warp size, add a comment explaining what a warp is and why its size is important for performance (e.g., memory coalescing, SIMT execution).

Thinking:
The program should be a minimal CUDA C++ source file that queries the current GPU device's warp size and prints it to the console. After printing, we need to provide a comment explaining the concept of a warp and why the warp size matters for performance. CUDA C++ provides the device property `warpSize` via `cudaDeviceProp`, which we can query using `cudaGetDeviceProperties`. We will use the host `printf` to output the value. The comment about warps will be placed after the print statement. The code will be self-contained and compile with `nvcc`. No additional kernel or device code is necessary, as the goal is simply to report and comment on the warp size. The final file will have only the required includes, the main function, and the comment, with no extraneous output or information.

#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int device = 0;
    cudaDeviceProp prop;
    cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, device);

    std::cout << "Warp size: " << prop.warpSize << std::endl;

    /* 
     * A warp is a group of 32 CUDA threads that execute the same instruction 
     * simultaneously in a SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Threads) fashion. 
     * The warp size is critical for performance because:
     * - Memory coalescing: Sequential memory accesses by threads in the same warp 
     *   can be combined into fewer memory transactions, reducing latency.
     * - SIMT execution: All threads in a warp follow the same execution path; 
     *   divergent branches cause serialization, hurting throughput.
     * Therefore, aligning data structures and controlling thread divergence to 
     * match warp boundaries maximizes GPU efficiency.
