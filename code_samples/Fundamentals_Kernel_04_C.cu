/*
Modify the kernel so each thread prints `gridDim.x - 1 - blockIdx.x` (its block index from the end of the grid).

Thinking: The requirement is to adjust the kernel so that every thread outputs the block index measured from the end of the grid. The expression `gridDim.x - 1 - blockIdx.x` yields the reversed index: block 0 becomes gridDim.x -1, block 1 becomes gridDim.x -2, etc. Since each thread should print this value, we simply compute it inside the kernel and use `printf`. The rest of the program is a minimal CUDA host code: allocate no device memory, launch a kernel with a few blocks and threads, synchronize, and exit. Error checking is optional but added for robustness. The code uses `__global__` kernel and prints using the device `printf`. The host program includes necessary headers, sets grid and block dimensions, and calls the kernel. After the kernel execution, we synchronize and optionally check for errors. This satisfies the requirement and is self-contained.
