/*
Aim of the program: Calculate the total number of threads on the host (`gridDim.x * blockDim.x`) and pass it to the kernel. Inside the kernel, print the global ID and the total number of threads.

Thinking:
We want to create a simple CUDA program that demonstrates how to compute the total number of threads launched from the host side and then pass that information to the kernel. In CUDA, the grid and block dimensions are set on the host when invoking a kernel. While `gridDim.x` and `blockDim.x` are device-side variables that give the dimensions for each kernel invocation, the host can simply multiply the chosen block and grid sizes to obtain the same value. This total is then passed as a kernel argument.

On the device side, each thread calculates its unique global index using the standard formula:
    int gid = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
We will also receive the total thread count from the host, so each thread can print its global ID together with that count. For printing from the device we use the builtâ€‘in `printf` function which is available on devices that support compute capability >= 2.0. We add error checking after the kernel launch and synchronize the device before exiting.

We choose modest block and grid sizes that are easy to reason about (e.g. 256 threads per block and 4 blocks, giving 1024 threads). The program will compile with nvcc and run, printing 1024 lines, one per thread.
