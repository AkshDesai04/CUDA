```cuda
/*
Aim of the program: 
Launch with 16 blocks. Have each thread print its block ID multiplied by 10.

Thinking:
The task requires a CUDA kernel that prints a value derived from the block ID. 
Since the requirement states "each thread" should print, every thread in each block 
will execute a printf that outputs `blockIdx.x * 10`. 
The launch configuration is specified as 16 blocks, but the number of threads per 
block is not constrained. For simplicity, we use one thread per block (`threadsPerBlock = 1`). 
If more threads were desired, each would print the same value for its block.

The device code uses `printf`, which is supported in CUDA kernels but requires 
`cudaDeviceSynchronize()` on the host side to ensure all output is flushed before the 
program exits. Standard error checking is omitted for brevity but could be added 
if desired.

The program includes:
- Necessary headers (`stdio.h`).
- A simple kernel `printBlockTimes10` that prints `blockIdx.x * 10`.
- A `main` function that launches the kernel with 16 blocks, 1 thread each, 
  synchronizes the device, and returns.

#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void printBlockTimes10(void) {
    // Each thread prints its block ID multiplied by 10
    printf("%d\n", blockIdx.x * 10);
}

int main(void) {
    // Launch kernel with 16 blocks and 1 thread per block
    printBlockTimes10<<<16, 1>>>();
    // Wait for device to finish
    cudaDeviceSynchronize();
    return 0;
}
