I don’t have the ability to execute CUDA binaries or invoke `cuda-memcheck` from here, so I can’t run your program for you. However, I can walk you through what you would see in the output and how to interpret it, which should help you spot and fix any leaks that `cuda-memcheck` reports.

---

## How to run the program

```bash
# Compile your .cu file (e.g. leaky.cu)
nvcc -o leaky leaky.cu

# Run cuda-memcheck with full leak detection
cuda-memcheck --leak-check full ./leaky
```

`cuda-memcheck` will instrument your kernel launches and device memory allocations, then report any unfreed allocations after the program exits.

## Typical `cuda-memcheck` leak output

A simplified example of what you might see:

```
========= LEAK SUMMARY =========
  TOTAL:   10
  FREED:   5
  UNFREED: 5
  =================================
[1] 0x0000000100001abc: 16 bytes unfreed in device memory
    (allocators: [0x0000000123456a78])
    (source: my_kernel.cu:45)
```

- **TOTAL** – total number of allocations performed.
- **FREED** – number of allocations that were properly freed.
- **UNFREED** – number of allocations that were never freed (leaks).

Each leak entry gives you the address, size, the allocator that created it, and the source file/line where the allocation happened.

---

## What to look for

1. **Unfreed device memory**  
   If `UNFREED` is non‑zero, you have a leak. Search the source for the line numbers reported.

2. **Multiple allocations in a loop**  
   Allocating inside a loop without freeing inside the same loop often leads to leaks. Ensure `cudaMalloc` / `cudaFree` pairs are balanced.

3. **Early exit paths**  
   If your program exits early (e.g., on error) before freeing, those allocations leak. Use `goto`/`return` or RAII‑style wrappers to guarantee cleanup.

4. **Kernel launch failures**  
   A kernel that fails to launch or returns an error might skip cleanup code. Check return codes from `cudaLaunchKernel` or `cudaFuncGetAttributes` and add error handling.

5. **Implicit device memory usage**  
   Some libraries or driver calls internally allocate device memory. Those are usually cleaned up automatically, but if you see a leak that corresponds to a library call, verify that you are using it correctly (e.g., `cublasCreate`/`cublasDestroy`, `cusolverDnCreate`/`cusolverDnDestroy`).

---

## Common fixes

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Allocation inside a loop without a matching `cudaFree` | Move the `cudaFree` inside the loop or allocate once before the loop. |
| Early return after an error | Add a cleanup section (e.g., `goto cleanup;`) or wrap resources in RAII classes. |
| `cudaMemGetInfo` shows low free memory after program exit | Ensure all `cudaMalloc`/`cudaFree` calls are paired. |
| Leaks reported on a library handle | Call the corresponding destroy function before program termination. |

---

## Example debugging step

1. **Run with address sanitizer enabled** (if you also need to catch host leaks):
   ```bash
   export CUDA_SANITIZER_OPTIONS=leak_check=full
   cuda-memcheck ./leaky
   ```

2. **Identify the first leak**:
   ```bash
   [1] 0x0000000100001abc: 16 bytes unfreed in device memory (source: my_kernel.cu:45)
   ```

3. **Open `my_kernel.cu` at line 45**:
   ```cpp
   float *d_temp;
   cudaMalloc(&d_temp, 16);
   // ... maybe some kernel launches
   // Missing cudaFree(d_temp);
   ```

4. **Add the missing free**:
   ```cpp
   cudaFree(d_temp);
   ```

5. **Re‑run** and confirm that `UNFREED` drops to zero.

---

## Final notes

- Always check the **return status** of CUDA API calls (`cudaError_t`) and handle errors promptly.
- Use **resource‑managing wrappers** (e.g., `cudaMalloc`/`cudaFree` in a C++ RAII class) if you’re writing C++ code.
- For large applications, consider a **memory‑budgeting strategy** where you track allocated bytes and enforce a maximum before launching new kernels.

Once you have removed all the reported leaks, `cuda-memcheck` should report:

```
========= LEAK SUMMARY =========
  TOTAL:   X
  FREED:   X
  UNFREED: 0
```

If you still see leaks after applying these fixes, double‑check that every allocation has a corresponding deallocation, even in error paths. Good luck!
