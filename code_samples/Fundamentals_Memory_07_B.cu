/*
Aim of the program: 
Now do the reverse: allocate host memory with malloc, pass the host pointer to a kernel, and have the kernel try to dereference it. What happens? (This can cause an error or unspecified behavior).

My thinking:
The goal is to illustrate that CUDA kernels cannot dereference pointers that were allocated on the host with malloc. The host pointer points to memory in the CPU address space, which is not directly accessible to the GPU device. If we pass such a pointer to a kernel and attempt to read from it, the GPU will either throw a runtime error (e.g., “invalid device pointer”) or exhibit undefined behavior. To demonstrate this, we:
1. Allocate an integer array on the host with malloc.
2. Pass the raw host pointer to a simple kernel that tries to read the first element.
3. Launch the kernel and then synchronize to capture any errors.
4. Use cudaGetLastError() to check whether a launch error occurred.

The kernel itself is intentionally minimal – it just reads from the pointer and discards the value. The main focus is the error detection logic after the launch. We also include a check for any errors after kernel launch and after cudaDeviceSynchronize, printing out the error string if one is found. This program should compile with nvcc and when run, it will most likely produce a “invalid device pointer” error, demonstrating that passing host memory directly to a kernel is invalid in CUDA.
