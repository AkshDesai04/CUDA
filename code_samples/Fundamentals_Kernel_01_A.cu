```cuda
/*
Aim of the program:
Modify the program to launch the kernel with two blocks, each with one thread.

Thinking process:
1. Understand that the goal is to demonstrate launching a CUDA kernel with a specific grid and block configuration: 2 blocks, 1 thread per block.
2. Decide on a simple kernel that each thread can run independently. For demonstration, each thread will print its block and thread indices.
3. Use `dim3` for grid and block dimensions: `dim3 grid(2); dim3 block(1);`.
4. Set up a minimal host program that allocates any required data (none needed here), launches the kernel, and synchronizes.
5. Handle any errors from kernel launch and device synchronization.
6. Keep the code self-contained and compile-able with `nvcc`. The output is a `.cu` file as requested, with no additional text outside the code.
