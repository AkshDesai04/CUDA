/*
Define the block dimensions using a `dim3` variable: `dim3 block_dim(8, 8);`.

Thinking:
The task is to provide a CUDA C program that demonstrates the use of a `dim3` variable for block dimensions, specifically `dim3 block_dim(8, 8);`. The program should be a complete .cu file, compileable with `nvcc`. Since the prompt only requests the definition of block dimensions, a minimal kernel is sufficient. I will write a trivial kernel (`dummyKernel`) that does nothing or maybe performs a simple operation (like reading indices). In `main`, I will declare `block_dim` as instructed, set a simple grid dimension, launch the kernel, and then synchronize. Finally, I will print a message on the host confirming the block dimensions. No additional dependencies or complex logic are required. This satisfies the requirement to include the exact line from the prompt and demonstrates its usage in a working program.

    // Simple grid dimension (1 block in each dimension)

    // Launch the dummy kernel
