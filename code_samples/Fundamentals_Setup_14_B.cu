/*
Aim: Based on the asyncEngineCount, print a message like 'Device has X copy engines.' If the count is greater than 0, also print 'Data copy can be overlapped with kernel execution.'

Thinking: 
- The `asyncEngineCount` field in `cudaDeviceProp` represents the number of asynchronous copy engines available on a CUDA device.  
- A count of 0 means the device has no dedicated copy engines; a count > 0 indicates that copy operations can be overlapped with kernel execution.  
- The program will:
  1. Query the number of CUDA devices.
  2. Select the first device (device 0) for simplicity.
  3. Retrieve its properties with `cudaGetDeviceProperties`.
  4. Output the message with the copy engine count.
  5. If the count is greater than zero, also output the overlapping capability message.
- Error checking is performed for each CUDA API call, with error messages printed to `std::cerr` and the program returning a nonâ€‘zero exit code on failure.
