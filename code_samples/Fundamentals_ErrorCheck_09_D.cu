/*
Demonstrate that the exception is caught correctly by triggering an error (e.g., failed `cudaMalloc`).

Thinking:
1. We need to trigger a CUDA API failure in a way that we can catch as an exception in C++.
2. The easiest approach is to call `cudaMalloc` with an excessively large size that the GPU cannot allocate.
3. Since CUDA Runtime API functions return a `cudaError_t`, we will check the return value and manually throw a C++ exception if it indicates an error.
4. Wrap the allocation logic in a `try` block and catch `std::exception` to verify that the exception is handled properly.
5. In the catch block, print the error message so that we see evidence that the exception was caught.
6. Finally, free any allocated memory if allocation succeeds (though it shouldn't in this case).
7. The code will be compiled with a CUDA compiler (nvcc) and will target C++ exception handling, which is supported in modern CUDA compilers.
8. The program is self-contained and can be run to see the caught exception.
