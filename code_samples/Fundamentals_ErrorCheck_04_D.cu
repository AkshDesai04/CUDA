/*
Trigger the error by passing a `nullptr` for the pointer-to-a-pointer in `cudaMalloc` (`cudaMalloc(nullptr, 100)`).

To trigger the intended error, we simply call `cudaMalloc` with a `nullptr` as the first argument, which is invalid because CUDA expects a pointer to a memory pointer where it will store the device address. The CUDA runtime will return an error code, typically `cudaErrorInvalidValue`. The program checks this return value and prints the error string to confirm that the error has occurred. No kernel launch or additional CUDA operations are needed; the focus is solely on demonstrating the error condition.

This simple approach also ensures that the program compiles and runs on any system with a compatible CUDA toolkit, without requiring any device memory allocation or kernel code. It directly showcases the error handling mechanism provided by CUDA's API.
