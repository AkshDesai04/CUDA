/*
 * Aim of the program:
 * Explain the difference between `cudaDeviceReset()` and `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` in comments.
 *
 * My thinking:
 * The user wants a CUDA program that contains an explanation of the difference between
 * `cudaDeviceReset()` and `cudaDeviceSynchronize()`.  According to the developer
 * instructions, we must put the entire explanation in a multiline comment at the
 * top of the .cu file.  The comment should include the exact prompt text and then
 * the full reasoning.  After that, we need to provide a complete, compilable
 * CUDA C source file.  The code itself can be simple â€“ it should just illustrate
 * the two API calls so that a reader can see where they are used, but the focus
 * is on the comments that explain the difference.
 *
 * Key points to explain:
 * 1. `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` blocks the host until all preceding CUDA work
 *    (kernel launches, memory copies, etc.) has finished.  It does *not* reset
 *    the device, clear resources, or change the device state.
 * 2. `cudaDeviceReset()` destroys all CUDA resources (streams, events, memory)
 *    associated with the current device, resets the device to a clean state,
 *    and returns the device to the same state as if the program had just
 *    started.  It is typically called at program termination or when a user
 *    needs to start over on the same device.
 * 3. Both functions can return errors, so the code checks the return value.
 * 4. Calling `cudaDeviceReset()` after all work is finished is required when
 *    the program uses persistent contexts or wants to free memory for other
 *    applications.  It should not be called repeatedly during normal
 *    execution because it would tear down the current context.
 * 5. `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` is often used in profiling, debugging, or when
 *    the host needs to read back results from device memory.
 *
 * The following example program demonstrates both calls.  It launches a tiny
 * kernel, then uses `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` to wait for completion.  After
 * that it resets the device with `cudaDeviceReset()`.  The comments in the
 * code describe what each call does in this context.
