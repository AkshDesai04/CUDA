/*
Aim of the program:
Query and print the memory bus width of the primary GPU in bits.

Thinking:
The CUDA runtime API provides a struct `cudaDeviceProp` that contains detailed
information about each CUDA device. One of its fields, `memoryBusWidth`, reports
the width of the device's memory bus in bits. To obtain this value we simply
need to:

1. Select the primary device (device 0, which is the default when no
   other device has been chosen).
2. Call `cudaGetDeviceProperties` to fill a `cudaDeviceProp` instance.
3. Access the `memoryBusWidth` field and print it.

Error handling is important: each CUDA API call returns a
`cudaError_t`.  A small helper macro is used to check the return status and
report any failure.  If the device does not report a bus width (unlikely for
modern GPUs), the code will still print the value (typically 0).

The program is selfâ€‘contained, compiles with `nvcc`, and uses only the
CUDA runtime API and standard C++ I/O.
