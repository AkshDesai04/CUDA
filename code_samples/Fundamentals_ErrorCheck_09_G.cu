**Answer**

No, you cannot throw an exception from `__device__` code.  
CUDA’s device code runs on the GPU, which does not provide the full C++ runtime support required for exception handling.  

* The CUDA compiler and runtime do not implement the C++ exception mechanism (stack unwinding, `try/catch`, `throw`/`catch`, and the associated runtime library support).  
* Throwing an exception would require dynamic control flow changes (long jumps) and stack unwinding, which are not supported on the GPU architecture.  
* The device code is executed in a massively parallel environment where each thread has its own limited stack; managing exception propagation across thousands of threads would be infeasible.  
* Consequently, the CUDA programming model disallows `throw` in `__device__` functions and will generate a compilation error if you attempt it.  

Instead, error handling on the device is typically done with return codes, status flags, or by writing to error‑reporting memory that the host can later inspect.
