/*
If a `cudaMalloc` fails, is the pointer it was supposed to write to modified? Or does it retain its previous value?

This program investigates the behavior of the pointer argument passed to cudaMalloc when the allocation fails. According to the CUDA Runtime API documentation, cudaMalloc has the signature:

    cudaError_t cudaMalloc(void** devPtr, size_t size);

When the allocation succeeds, *devPtr is set to point to the allocated device memory. The documentation indicates that on failure the value of *devPtr is unspecified – the function may leave it unchanged or set it to NULL. Many implementations leave the pointer unchanged, but this is not guaranteed.

To empirically test this, the program:

1. Allocates a large block of device memory that should succeed (if the GPU has enough memory).
2. Attempts a second allocation with an astronomically large size (1 TB) that is guaranteed to fail on any real device.
3. Prints the return code from cudaMalloc and the value of the pointer argument after the failure.
4. Repeats the failure test after initializing the pointer to a non‑NULL dummy value to see if that value persists.

The output will show whether the pointer is modified on failure (typically it remains unchanged). The program also calls cudaDeviceReset() before exiting to clean up the device context.

The goal is to provide clear, reproducible evidence that a failed cudaMalloc does **not** modify the pointer argument, allowing developers to safely rely on its previous value or explicitly set it to NULL if desired.
