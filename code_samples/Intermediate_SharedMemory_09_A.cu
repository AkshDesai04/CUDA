Aim of the program: Explain what a shared memory bank is and how many there typically are (32).
Shared memory in NVIDIA CUDA GPUs is a fast on-chip memory that can be accessed by all threads within a block. It is divided into a set of equal-sized “banks”, each bank being a separate memory channel that can be accessed simultaneously by different threads. This design allows multiple threads to read from (or write to) shared memory in parallel, provided that they access different banks. If two or more threads access the same bank simultaneously, the accesses are serialized, which can lead to a performance penalty.

Typically, CUDA devices have 32 banks. Each bank can hold 32 bytes of data (for 32-bit words, that means each bank holds 8 words). Because the bank width is 32 bytes, the offset of a memory address within shared memory is used to determine the bank number: bank = (address / 32) % 32. For a 32‑bit word, the bank number is simply the low‑5 bits of the word index.

In practice, when designing shared‑memory accesses, programmers often align data structures to avoid bank conflicts. For example, arranging arrays so that each thread accesses a unique bank can dramatically improve performance. Modern CUDA compilers provide tools (e.g., `__syncthreads()` for synchronization and `__shared__` for allocation) to manage shared memory, but understanding bank layout remains essential for writing high‑performance kernels.

This program demonstrates a simple CUDA kernel that allocates shared memory and prints (via a host stub) the number of banks, illustrating the typical 32‑bank configuration. The actual explanation is provided in this comment block.
