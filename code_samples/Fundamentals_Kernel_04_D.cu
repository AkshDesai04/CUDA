```cpp
/*
Modify the kernel so that only blocks with an odd index print their ID.

Thinking:
The task requires altering a CUDA kernel so that only blocks whose index
(blockIdx.x) is odd will output their block ID using device-side printf.
To achieve this, each block will check if blockIdx.x % 2 == 1.
If true, it will perform the printf; otherwise, it will skip printing.
The kernel will be launched with multiple blocks (e.g., 16) and a single
thread per block, as only block-level information is needed. The main
function will handle CUDA error checking, kernel launch, and device
synchronization. The program is self-contained and can be compiled with
nvcc to produce a .cu executable.
