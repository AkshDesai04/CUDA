/*
Aim of the program: Also print the grid's dimension, `gridDim.x`, alongside the block index.

[Thinking]
- The program demonstrates how to access and display the grid dimension (`gridDim.x`) and the block index (`blockIdx.x`) from within a CUDA kernel.
- It uses a simple kernel that prints information only from one thread per block to avoid cluttering the output.
- Host code sets up a grid with a few blocks (e.g., 4) and a single thread per block, then launches the kernel.
- After the kernel execution, the host synchronizes the device and checks for errors.
- The output will show each blockâ€™s index and the total number of blocks in the grid.
- All necessary headers are included and the code is ready to be compiled with `nvcc`.
