If you omit the `__syncthreads()` right after all threads have finished loading data into shared memory, you create a data‑dependency race condition between threads.

* Each thread reads from shared memory later in the kernel (for example, to compute a reduction, a stencil, or to pass the data to another stage).
* Because there is no barrier, a thread may reach that read before the thread that owns the particular shared‑memory location has finished writing it.
* The reading thread will therefore see whatever happened to be in that shared‑memory cell at that moment – often a stale value, or even garbage if the cell had never been written yet.
* This leads to **undefined behavior**: the kernel will produce incorrect results, and in some cases the program may crash or hang if the mis‑synchronised memory access causes a segmentation fault or leads to a deadlock in subsequent code.

In short, forgetting `__syncthreads()` after the load phase means you lose the guarantee that all shared‑memory writes are visible to all threads before any reads occur, so the kernel may read incomplete or corrupted data, producing wrong results or unpredictable behavior.
