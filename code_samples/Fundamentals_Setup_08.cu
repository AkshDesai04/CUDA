/*
 * Aim: Write a program that prints the CUDA driver version and the CUDA runtime version detected on your system. 
 * Use cudaDriverGetVersion and cudaRuntimeGetVersion and explain in a comment what the difference between the two is.
 *
 * Thinking:
 * 1. Include <cuda_runtime.h> to get access to CUDA runtime API functions and error handling macros.
 * 2. We'll call cudaDriverGetVersion(&driverVersion) which returns the driver version as an integer where the high 2 digits are major version, next two digits minor, last two digits patch.
 * 3. We'll call cudaRuntimeGetVersion(&runtimeVersion) similarly.
 * 4. Both functions return cudaError_t; check for errors and print appropriate message if fails.
 * 5. Format the version integers into major.minor.patch string for readability. Compute major = version/1000, minor = (version%1000)/10, patch = version%10.
 * 6. Print both versions to stdout.
 * 7. Add a comment explaining difference:
 *    - cudaDriverGetVersion retrieves the version of the installed NVIDIA driver (the GPU driver that runs in kernel space).
 *    - cudaRuntimeGetVersion retrieves the version of the CUDA Runtime API library (libcudart) bundled with the CUDA Toolkit (userâ€‘space library).
 *    The driver can be newer or older than the runtime; both are required for proper operation but represent different layers.
 * 8. Use a simple main function and return 0 on success.

/*
 * Explanation:
 *  - cudaDriverGetVersion queries the NVIDIA GPU driver installed on the host machine. 
 *    This driver operates in kernel space and provides low-level GPU functionality.
 *  - cudaRuntimeGetVersion queries the CUDA Runtime library (libcudart) bundled with the CUDA Toolkit.
 *    The runtime library runs in user space and provides the high-level API that developers call.
 *  They may not always match because the driver can be upgraded independently of the toolkit/runtime,
 *  and the runtime may have a newer or older version than the driver.
