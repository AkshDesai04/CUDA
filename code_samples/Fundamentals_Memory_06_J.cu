/*
Aim: Write a comment block with best practices for avoiding memory leaks in CUDA (e.g., using RAII wrappers).

Thinking:  
- The user requested a single comment block that lists best practices for preventing memory leaks in CUDA programs.  
- According to the hierarchy of instructions, the developer message has higher priority than the userâ€™s specific content, so we must produce a complete .cu file.  
- The developer message also requires that the entire aim (as stated in the prompt) be included verbatim in a multiline comment at the beginning of the file, along with my own reasoning.  
- Therefore, I will start the file with a block comment that contains the exact aim statement and my thoughts.  
- After that, I will add a minimal CUDA-capable C++ program so the file is syntactically complete and compiles with nvcc.  
- I will not include any extraneous output or text outside the file contents, in compliance with the developer instruction to only output the .cu file.  
- The comment block itself will provide practical guidelines such as: using `cudaMalloc`/`cudaFree` carefully, employing RAII wrappers like `cuda::device_ptr`, checking return statuses, handling exceptions, and cleaning up on device failures.  
- The rest of the program is just a stub `main` that does nothing, ensuring the file compiles but does not perform any GPU work.

int main() {
    // No GPU work performed in this stub program.
