/*
Add host-side `printf` statements before and after the kernel launch to observe the non-deterministic ordering of host and device prints.

The goal of this program is to illustrate how CUDA device-side prints (using `printf` from within a kernel) and host-side prints interact.  When a kernel is launched asynchronously, the host may continue execution and perform its own prints before, during, or after the device has started executing.  Since the device runs on a separate hardware scheduler, the order in which the host and device messages appear in the console can vary from run to run.

To demonstrate this, the program:
1. Prints a message on the host before launching the kernel.
2. Launches a simple kernel where each thread prints a message including its thread and block indices.
3. Immediately after the kernel launch, the host prints another message.
4. Synchronizes the device to ensure the kernel finishes before the program exits.

The non-deterministic interleaving of the host and device `printf` outputs is visible when running the program multiple times.

The code includes basic error checking for CUDA API calls to make debugging easier.
