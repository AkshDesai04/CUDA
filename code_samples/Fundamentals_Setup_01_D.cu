```cuda
/* 
Aim: Query and print the number of multiprocessors on the primary CUDA device (device 0).

Thinking:
- The program needs to run on a CUDA-capable GPU, specifically device 0.
- To obtain the number of multiprocessors (also known as SMs), we use the CUDA Runtime API.
- First, we query the total number of devices with cudaGetDeviceCount to ensure at least one device exists.
- Then, we use cudaGetDeviceProperties to fill a cudaDeviceProp structure for device 0.
- The field `multiProcessorCount` in cudaDeviceProp holds the number of multiprocessors.
- We print this value to standard output.
- Basic error checking is added for robustness, though not strictly required for the minimal task.
- The code is self-contained and can be compiled with nvcc as a .cu file.
