```c
/*
Aim of the program: Also print the grid's 2D dimensions (`gridDim.x`, `gridDim.y`).

Thinking:
- The objective is to demonstrate how a CUDA kernel can access and display the 2D grid dimensions.
- We'll write a simple kernel that prints the thread indices, block indices, and the grid dimensions.
- `gridDim` is a builtâ€‘in variable available inside a kernel, so we can use it directly in `printf`.
- The host will launch the kernel with a 2D grid and a 2D block configuration.
- After the kernel execution, the host will also print the grid dimensions to confirm consistency.
- Device side `printf` requires CUDA 2.0 or later; compilation with `nvcc` and an appropriate compute capability
  will allow the output to be visible.
- Basic error checking is added to catch any launch or synchronization failures.
