/*
Aim: Trigger cudaErrorInvalidValue by passing a negative size to cudaMalloc.

Thinking:
- The CUDA runtime function `cudaMalloc(void **devPtr, size_t size)` expects an unsigned size.
- To trigger `cudaErrorInvalidValue`, we need to pass a size that is considered invalid.
- According to CUDA documentation, passing a size of 0 or a negative value results in `cudaErrorInvalidValue`.
- In C, `size_t` is unsigned, so we can't directly write a negative literal. However, we can cast a negative integer to `size_t`, which will convert it to a very large unsigned value.
- Using `size_t size = (size_t)-1;` effectively sets the size to the maximum possible value, which should be treated as invalid by the CUDA runtime, producing `cudaErrorInvalidValue`.
- The program will allocate memory with this size, check the returned error code, and print a message indicating the error.
- No further CUDA operations are performed since allocation fails.
- This demonstrates the error handling and validation within the CUDA API.

int main() {
    void *devPtr = NULL;
    // Intentionally set size to a negative value by casting
    size_t size = (size_t)-1;  // This is effectively a very large value

    cudaError_t err = cudaMalloc(&devPtr, size);

    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        fprintf(stderr, "cudaMalloc failed with error: %s (%d)\n", cudaGetErrorString(err), err);
    } else {
        // This branch should not be executed for negative size
        printf("cudaMalloc succeeded unexpectedly.\n");
        // Free the allocated memory (if any)
        cudaFree(devPtr);
    }

    return 0;
