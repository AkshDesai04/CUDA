```cpp
/*
Aim of the program: 
Try to use `memcpy` or `std::copy` with a device pointer. What happens?

Thinking:
- In CUDA C/C++, device memory resides in GPU address space and is not directly accessible from the host CPU.
- Standard library functions like `memcpy` and `std::copy` are designed for host memory; they perform memory operations in CPU address space.
- If you pass a device pointer to these functions on the host side, the compiler treats it as a regular pointer. 
  The function will try to read/write from the host address space, which either:
    * causes a segmentation fault (undefined behavior) because the address is not valid in host memory, or
    * silently copies zero bytes if the address happens to be null or invalid.
- Inside a CUDA kernel, using `memcpy` (the CPU version) is also illegal because the kernel runs on the GPU and the host `memcpy` is not available in device code. You would need `cudaMemcpy` or device-to-device copy operations.
- CUDA provides `cudaMemcpy` (or the newer `cudaMemcpyAsync`) for host-to-device, device-to-host, and device-to-device copies.
- For generic C++ algorithms on device data, the Thrust library offers `thrust::copy` which can work with device pointers.
- Therefore, attempting to use `memcpy` or `std::copy` with a device pointer either results in a compile-time error (if used in device code), a runtime crash, or a no-op, and is not the correct way to transfer data to/from GPU memory.

The program below demonstrates the misuse: it allocates device memory, attempts to copy host data into it using `std::copy`, checks the result, and reports the observed behavior. It then correctly copies the data using `cudaMemcpy` for comparison.
