/*
Query the device property for `unifiedAddressing`. If true, explain what this means for host and device pointers.

I will write a small CUDA host program that queries the properties of the first CUDA device using cudaGetDeviceProperties. 
The program will print the value of the unifiedAddressing field, which is a boolean indicating whether the device 
supports unified virtual addressing. If this flag is true, I will output an explanation: host and device share a 
single virtual address space, meaning that pointers can be passed directly between host and device kernels 
without needing explicit cudaMemcpy calls for data that resides in unified memory (e.g., allocated with 
cudaMallocManaged). This also simplifies debugging and memory management in CUDA programs. The code will
include basic error checking and use standard CUDA API calls. The output will be printed to the console
with descriptive text. The program will compile with nvcc and run on any system with at least one CUDA
device.
