/*
Does a failed `cudaMalloc` return a `nullptr` and a success code, or does it return an error code directly? Check the documentation and your test.

Thought Process:
- According to the CUDA Runtime API documentation, `cudaMalloc` returns a `cudaError_t` status code.
- On success, the status is `cudaSuccess` and the pointer is set to point to the allocated memory.
- On failure, the status is an error code (e.g., `cudaErrorMemoryAllocation`) and the pointer is left unchanged (i.e., the value passed to the function remains as it was before the call).
- To confirm this behavior, the program will:
  1. Initialize a device pointer to `nullptr`.
  2. Attempt to allocate an intentionally huge amount of memory that is likely to fail.
  3. Check the return status from `cudaMalloc`.
  4. Print the status and the pointer value after the call.
  5. The expectation is that the status will be an error code and the pointer will remain `nullptr`.
- The program uses simple error printing and does not rely on external libraries beyond the CUDA runtime.
- The test size chosen is 1 TiB (1 << 40 bytes) which is far beyond typical device memory, ensuring failure on most GPUs.
