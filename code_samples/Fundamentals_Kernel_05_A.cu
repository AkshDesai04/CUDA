/*
Aim: Change the launch configuration to 8 blocks of 32 threads and verify the global IDs are still unique and correct.

Thinking:
The original program was likely using a different launch configuration to compute global thread IDs using the common formula
    global_id = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x
This formula is independent of the number of blocks or threads per block as long as the grid and block dimensions are consistent.
Changing to 8 blocks of 32 threads means we will have a total of 8 * 32 = 256 threads. 
We want to ensure that each thread's global ID ranges from 0 to 255 and that all IDs are unique. 

To verify this, the kernel will write its global ID into a device array at the index equal to the global ID.
After the kernel finishes, the host will copy this array back and check that each element matches its index.
If all checks pass, we print a success message; otherwise, we print the mismatched entries.

We also include basic CUDA error checking to make debugging easier.

The program is self-contained and can be compiled with nvcc and run on a CUDA-capable device.
