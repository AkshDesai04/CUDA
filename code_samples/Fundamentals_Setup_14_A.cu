/*
Aim of the program: A more direct property is `deviceOverlap`. Query and print this boolean property for the primary device.

Thinking:
To achieve this, we will write a simple CUDA host program in C that queries the `cudaDeviceProp` structure for the primary device (device 0). The `deviceOverlap` field of this structure indicates whether the device can simultaneously execute kernels and copy memory. Since this field is an integer (0 or 1), we will cast it to a boolean for clarity when printing. 

The program flow will be:
1. Include the necessary headers (`<stdio.h>` and `<cuda_runtime.h>`).
2. Define a helper macro `CHECK_CUDA` for error checking after CUDA API calls.
3. In `main`, call `cudaGetDeviceCount` to confirm at least one device is present.
4. Use `cudaGetDeviceProperties` to retrieve the properties for device 0.
5. Print the value of `deviceOverlap` as either `true` or `false`.
6. Return 0.

We will ensure the code compiles as a `.cu` file, so no CUDA kernel is needed. The program is selfâ€‘contained and prints the required boolean property. */
