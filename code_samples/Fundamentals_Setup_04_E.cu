/*
Aim of the program: Calculate and print the theoretical maximum number of concurrent warps the entire GPU can run.

Thinking:
The theoretical maximum number of concurrent warps is determined by the GPU architecture.
For each Streaming Multiprocessor (SM), CUDA can run a certain maximum number of threads
simultaneously, given by the device property maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor.
Since a warp consists of warpSize threads (typically 32), the maximum number of concurrent
warps per SM is simply maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor / warpSize.
The entire GPU contains multiProcessorCount SMs, so the total theoretical maximum number of
concurrent warps is:
    total_warps = multiProcessorCount * (maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor / warpSize)

The program will:
1. Query the number of CUDA devices.
2. For each device, retrieve its properties.
3. Compute total_warps using the formula above.
4. Print the result.

We will use the CUDA Runtime API functions:
- cudaGetDeviceCount to get the number of devices.
- cudaGetDeviceProperties to fetch the device properties.

The program will output a single integer per device, indicating the theoretical maximum
concurrent warps for that GPU.

Error handling is minimal; we check the return status of CUDA API calls and print an error
message if something goes wrong. The program is selfâ€‘contained in a single .cu file and
requires a CUDA-capable compiler (nvcc) to build.
