/* 
   Aim of the program: 
   Can threads in different blocks synchronize with __syncthreads()? 
   Explain why not. 
   
   Thinking:
   __syncthreads() is a barrier that synchronizes only the threads
   within the same block. It ensures that all threads in a block have
   reached the same point and that all shared memory writes are visible
   to the other threads of that block. 
   
   Threads in different blocks execute independently and the hardware
   does not provide a mechanism for a single __syncthreads() call to
   coordinate across blocks. If a programmer tries to use __syncthreads()
   to synchronize blocks, the result is undefined: the blocks may
   execute in any order, or concurrently, and there is no guarantee
   that a write by one block will be visible to another block before
   it starts executing.  To synchronize between blocks one must use
   separate kernel launches, cooperative groups, or atomic operations
   with global memory fences.  This program demonstrates that
   __syncthreads() does not synchronize across blocks by attempting
   to make one block set a flag that another block waits for.  The
   waiting block may start executing before the flag is set, showing
   that no guarantee of order is provided by __syncthreads().
