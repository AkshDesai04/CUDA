/*
Aim of the program: Explain in a comment what a grid of blocks is in the CUDA execution model.

Thinking:
- The user wants an explanation of a CUDA grid of blocks in a comment.
- According to the developer instruction, we must include this aim verbatim in a multiline comment at the top of the file.
- Additionally, we must add our entire thought process to that comment for clarity.
- The rest of the file should contain a valid CUDA .cu file, so we include a minimal kernel and a main function to keep it compilable.
- No extra output or supporting information should be provided; only the .cu file content.

Explanation (within the comment):
A CUDA grid is a collection of thread blocks that launch together on a GPU. 
Each block contains a set of threads, and the grid dimension (gridDim) specifies how many blocks are in the grid along each axis (x, y, z). 
Threads within a block can cooperate via shared memory and synchronize using __syncthreads(), but threads in different blocks cannot synchronize except at kernel launch or termination. 
The grid of blocks is the topâ€‘level organization of parallel work in CUDA: the GPU schedules these blocks onto streaming multiprocessors (SMs), which then schedule the threads within each block. 
The total number of threads executed is gridDim * blockDim in each dimension. 
This hierarchy allows for massive parallelism while providing a structured way to address and manage threads.
