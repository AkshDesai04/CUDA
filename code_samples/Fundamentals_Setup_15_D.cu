/*
Aim of the program:
Write a program with multiple threads, where each thread sets a different GPU device. Have one thread call `cudaDeviceReset()` and discuss the potential implications for the other threads.

Thinking and design decisions:

1. **Threading model**  
   The program uses the C++11 `<thread>` library to spawn multiple CPU threads.  
   Each thread will call `cudaSetDevice` with a unique device ID so that the CUDA context
   created inside each thread is specific to that device.

2. **CUDA context**  
   - `cudaSetDevice` creates (or switches to) a per-thread CUDA context.  
   - In CUDA, each host thread has its own context unless the device is explicitly shared with `cudaDeviceEnablePeerAccess`.  
   - This program does *not* share contexts between threads; each thread is isolated.

3. **Kernel launch**  
   Each thread launches a very simple kernel (`helloKernel`) that writes a character into a device array.  
   The kernel does not need any device memory beyond a small array.

4. **Device reset**  
   One thread (the first thread) will call `cudaDeviceReset()` after launching its kernel.  
   `cudaDeviceReset` destroys the current context, frees all resources associated with it, and puts the device
   into a clean state. The implications for other threads are:

   - If the resetting thread's device is shared by other threads, those threads would see their
     context destroyed and subsequent CUDA calls would fail (likely with `cudaErrorContextIsDestroyed`).
   - In this program, each thread uses a *different* device, so the reset only affects the resetting
     thread's context. The other threads continue to run normally on their own devices.
   - If the program were extended to use a single device across multiple threads, calling
     `cudaDeviceReset` from one thread would render the device unusable for all threads that share the same context.
     This demonstrates why careful synchronization or context management is essential in multi-threaded CUDA applications.

5. **Error handling**  
   All CUDA API calls are wrapped in a helper function `checkCudaError` that prints the error
   and aborts if a call fails.

6. **Compilation**  
   The file is a `.cu` source that can be compiled with `nvcc`:
   ```
   nvcc -std=c++11 -o multi_thread_devices multi_thread_devices.cu
   ```

7. **Execution**  
   The program prints messages from each thread, including the device ID and the kernel output.
   It also prints a message when the device reset is performed.
