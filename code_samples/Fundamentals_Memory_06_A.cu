```cuda
/*
Aim: Write the memory-leaking code inside a function. Call this function in a loop in main to leak memory more quickly.

Thinking:
1. The goal is to create a program that intentionally leaks memory in order to demonstrate or test memory leak detection tools. 
2. We can leak both host and device memory to increase the leak rate.
3. We'll write a simple helper function `leakMemory()` that:
   - Allocates a block of device memory using `cudaMalloc` and never frees it.
   - Allocates a block of host memory using `malloc` and never frees it.
4. In `main()` we will call this function repeatedly in a loop, e.g., 1000 times, to quickly accumulate a large amount of unreleased memory.
5. The program will compile with NVCC and run on a system with CUDA-capable GPU. 
6. No kernel launches or other GPU work are necessary; the focus is purely on memory allocation.
7. We include minimal error checking just to keep the code clear and portable.
