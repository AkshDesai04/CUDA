/*
Query and print the maximum dimensions (width and height) of a 2D texture for device 0.

Thought process:
- The goal is to query the hardware capabilities of the first CUDA device (device 0) and report the maximum size that can be used for a 2D texture.
- Use the CUDA runtime API, specifically cudaGetDeviceProperties, which fills a cudaDeviceProp structure with all relevant properties of a device.
- Device 0 is selected by calling cudaSetDevice(0). This is not strictly required for cudaGetDeviceProperties, but it ensures that the device context is set correctly.
- The cudaDeviceProp structure contains a field `maxTexture2D` of type dim3, which holds the maximum width, height, and depth for 2D textures. We read the `width` and `height` components.
- Provide error checking after each CUDA call so that any issues are reported to stderr.
- Output the device name, width, and height using printf to stdout.
- The program is a minimal, selfâ€‘contained CUDA host program written in C/C++ that can be compiled with `nvcc` into an executable.
