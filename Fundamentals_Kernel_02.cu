The single thread in the kernel should use \\`printf\\` to print \'Hello from the GPU!\'. Note that the output from the GPU might appear at a different time than host-side prints.`\n\n""" \nThe goal is to create a minimal CUDA C program that launches a kernel with a single thread, where that thread uses the device `printf` function to print the message "Hello from the GPU!". After the kernel launch we must call `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` to wait for the kernel to finish and flush the device-side printf output. Additionally, we provide error checking for the kernel launch and the synchronization step. Finally, a host-side print is included to demonstrate that host and device prints can appear in a different order. The program includes the necessary headers (`stdio.h` and `cuda_runtime.h`), defines a simple kernel, and contains a `main` function that performs the launch, synchronization, and host print. This code is fully compilable with `nvcc`. \n"""\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n__global__ void helloGPU() {\n    // Device printf prints to the console once the kernel finishes\n    printf("Hello from the GPU!\\n");\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    // Launch the kernel with 1 block of 1 thread\n    helloGPU<<<1, 1>>>();\n\n    // Check for any errors during kernel launch\n    cudaError_t err = cudaGetLastError();\n    if (err != cudaSuccess) {\n        fprintf(stderr, "Kernel launch failed: %s\\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    // Synchronize to ensure the kernel completes and device printf output is flushed\n    err = cudaDeviceSynchronize();\n    if (err != cudaSuccess) {\n        fprintf(stderr, "cudaDeviceSynchronize failed: %s\\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    // Host-side print\n    printf("Hello from the host!\\n");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n', images=None, tool_calls=None)
