Have only the thread at (0, 0) print a message.`\n\n""" \nThe task is to create a minimal CUDA program that launches a single block of size 8x8 (64 threads). Inside the kernel, only the thread located at coordinates (0,0) within the block should execute a printf statement to output a message. All other threads should remain idle (i.e., perform no operation). \n\nKey points to implement:\n1. Include the necessary header for device-side printing: <cstdio>.\n2. Define a __global__ kernel that checks threadIdx.x and threadIdx.y against 0. If both are zero, call printf to print a descriptive message.\n3. In the host main function:\n   - Configure block and grid dimensions: dim3 blockDim(8,8); dim3 gridDim(1,1).\n   - Launch the kernel with these dimensions.\n   - Call cudaDeviceSynchronize() to ensure the device finishes execution before the host program exits, which guarantees that the device-side printf output is flushed to stdout.\n4. Add minimal error checking after kernel launch (optional but good practice).\n5. Keep the program concise and compilable with nvcc on GPUs supporting device-side printf (compute capability 2.0 or higher). \n\nThe final code will compile with `nvcc -arch=sm_20 -o kernel kernel.cu` and run on a compatible GPU, printing the message only once from the (0,0) thread. \n"""\n\n#include <cstdio>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n__global__ void printOnlyThread00()\n{\n    if (threadIdx.x == 0 && threadIdx.y == 0)\n    {\n        printf("Hello from thread (0,0) in block (%d,%d)!\\n", blockIdx.x, blockIdx.y);\n    }\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    dim3 blockDim(8, 8);\n    dim3 gridDim(1, 1);\n\n    printOnlyThread00<<<gridDim, blockDim>>>();\n\n    cudaError_t err = cudaGetLastError();\n    if (err != cudaSuccess)\n    {\n        fprintf(stderr, "Kernel launch failed: %s\\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    err = cudaDeviceSynchronize();\n    if (err != cudaSuccess)\n    {\n        fprintf(stderr, "cudaDeviceSynchronize failed: %s\\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n', images=None, tool_calls=None)
