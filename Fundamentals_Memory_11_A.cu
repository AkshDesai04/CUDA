```cpp
/*
Aim of the program:
Explain in a comment the properties of constant memory (cached, read-only for kernel, low latency when all threads in a warp access the same address).

Thinking process:
1. The user specifically asked for a comment explaining constant memory properties.  
2. The developer instruction mandates that we produce a complete .cu file, with a multiline comment at the beginning that contains the exact aim of the program as given in the user prompt, followed by the developer's own thoughts.  
3. After that comment, the actual code must be provided.  
4. To satisfy both the explanatory comment and the requirement for a CUDA program, I will write a simple CUDA example that:
   - Declares a constant memory array (`__constant__`).
   - Copies data from host to this constant memory region.
   - Launches a kernel that reads the constant memory and stores the result in global memory.
   - Copies the results back to host and prints them.  
5. The example is minimal, compiles with `nvcc`, and demonstrates the use of constant memory while keeping the focus on the requested explanation.
