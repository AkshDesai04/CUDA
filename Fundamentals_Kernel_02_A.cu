Observe the output.`\n\n""" \nIn this CUDA program we will create a simple kernel that prints the thread index and block index from each thread. \nWe want to launch the kernel with exactly one block that contains 10 threads. \nThe kernel will use printf which is supported on devices with compute capability >= 2.0. \nAfter launching the kernel we will call cudaDeviceSynchronize() to ensure all printf output is flushed before the program exits. \nThe main function will simply launch the kernel and handle any potential errors. \nThe program is fully selfâ€‘contained and can be compiled with nvcc: \n    nvcc -o print_kernel print_kernel.cu \nand then run: \n    ./print_kernel \nThe expected output is a list of 10 lines, one per thread. \n"""\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n__global__ void printKernel()\n{\n    // Each thread prints its own thread and block index\n    printf("Hello from thread %d in block %d\\n", threadIdx.x, blockIdx.x);\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    // Launch one block with 10 threads\n    printKernel<<<1, 10>>>();\n\n    // Wait for kernel to finish and flush all printf output\n    cudaError_t err = cudaDeviceSynchronize();\n    if (err != cudaSuccess) {\n        fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error after kernel launch: %s\\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // Reset device (optional)\n    cudaDeviceReset();\n\n    return 0;\n}\n', images=None, tool_calls=None)
