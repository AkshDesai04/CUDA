```cuda
/*
Aim of the program: 
Modify the kernel so that only threads with an even index print their ID. 

Thinking process:
1. The requirement is to alter a CUDA kernel so that only threads whose global index
   (e.g., threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x) is even will output their ID.
2. Device-side printing in CUDA is done with printf. 
3. To keep the example minimal, the program will:
   - Define a kernel that calculates a global thread index.
   - Check if the index is even; if so, call printf to print the ID.
4. Host code will launch the kernel with a configurable number of blocks and threads,
   then synchronize and return.
5. Error checking macros will be added for robustness.
6. Since printf is used, we need to compile for a compute capability that supports it
   (â‰¥ sm_20) which is the default for most GPUs.
7. The final code will be a single .cu file with the comment block at the top
   containing the aim and this reasoning, followed by the full program.
