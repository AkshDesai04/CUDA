/*
Aim of the program:
Modify the kernel so that only threads with an even index print their ID.

Thinking:
The task is to create a simple CUDA program that demonstrates how to filter threads based on
their index before performing an operationâ€”in this case, printing their ID.  
CUDA allows device-side printing via `printf`, but it must be enabled at compile time with the
`--compiler-options` flag or by using the appropriate compiler options in the Makefile or
NVCC command. Since this is a minimal example, we will rely on the default compilation settings
which enable device printf.

Key points considered:
1. Use a single block with a reasonable number of threads (e.g., 256) to keep output manageable.
2. In the kernel, use `threadIdx.x` as the thread identifier and check if it is even using
   the modulus operator.
3. Only threads that satisfy the condition will call `printf`.
4. After launching the kernel, the host program calls `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` to wait for all
   device work to finish and ensure that all printed messages appear before the program exits.
5. Basic error checking macro is provided for clarity, although for a simple demo it may be
   optional.

The program compiles to a .cu file and can be compiled with:
nvcc -arch=sm_30 -o even_threads even_threads.cu
or with any other architecture that supports device printf.

This file contains the entire code from start to finish, ready to be compiled and executed.
