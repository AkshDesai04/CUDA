```c
/*
Aim of the program:
Launch with a 1D block of 32 threads. Have each thread print its warp ID (`threadIdx.x / 32`).

Thinking:
- We need to use a CUDA kernel that runs on the device.
- Each thread in a block has a unique threadIdx.x.
- A warp is a group of 32 threads, so the warp ID can be computed as integer division of threadIdx.x by 32.
- We'll use `printf` inside the kernel to output the thread ID and warp ID.
- Since device `printf` requires a compute capability of at least 2.0, we assume the target GPU supports it.
- The kernel launch configuration will be one block with 32 threads: `dim3 blockDim(32);`.
- After launching the kernel, we call `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` on the host to ensure the kernel has finished executing before the program exits.
- We include necessary headers: `<cstdio>` for `printf` and CUDA headers for launch.
