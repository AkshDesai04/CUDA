Verify the call was successful by then calling cudaGetDevice and printing the result.`\n\n"""\nThe goal is to create a minimal CUDA C program that demonstrates setting the active device\nto device 0 with cudaSetDevice, then retrieving the current device with cudaGetDevice and\nprinting it. The program should compile as a .cu file and run on a system with CUDA\ninstalled. We\'ll include the standard CUDA runtime header, use error checking to ensure\nthat both calls succeed, and use printf to output the result.\n\nKey steps:\n1. Include <cuda_runtime.h> and <stdio.h>.\n2. Define a simple error-checking helper that prints a message and exits if an error occurs.\n3. In main:\n   - Call cudaSetDevice(0) and check the returned cudaError_t.\n   - Call cudaGetDevice(&dev) and check the returned error.\n   - Print the device index.\n4. Compile with nvcc and run.\n\nEdge cases:\n- If there is no CUDA device, cudaSetDevice will return an error; we will print that.\n- The program will exit early on any error.\n\nThe code is straightforward and portable across CUDA-enabled GPUs.\n"""\n\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n/* Simple error-checking helper */\nstatic void checkCudaError(cudaError_t err, const char *msg)\n{\n    if (err != cudaSuccess)\n    {\n        fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error: %s: %s\\n", msg, cudaGetErrorString(err));\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n    }\n}\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    cudaError_t err;\n    int device = -1;\n\n    /* Explicitly set device 0 */\n    err = cudaSetDevice(0);\n    checkCudaError(err, "Failed to set device 0");\n\n    /* Retrieve the current device */\n    err = cudaGetDevice(&device);\n    checkCudaError(err, "Failed to get current device");\n\n    /* Print the result */\n    printf("Device set to 0 successfully.
