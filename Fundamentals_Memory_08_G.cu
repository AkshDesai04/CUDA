/*
 * Aim of the program:
 * Compare the timing from CUDA events to timing with std::chrono::high_resolution_clock.
 * Explain why CUDA events are more accurate for timing GPU operations.
 *
 * Thinking process:
 * 1. The goal is to provide a clear, minimal example that shows both timing methods
 *    and demonstrates the difference in accuracy and the source of any discrepancy.
 * 2. We need a simple GPU kernel that does a non-trivial amount of work. A vector
 *    addition is easy to understand and requires a few memory copies and a kernel
 *    launch, which are the primary operations we want to time.
 * 3. For CUDA timing we will create two events (start and stop), record the start
 *    just before the kernel launch, record the stop just after the kernel launch,
 *    and then synchronize the stop event before measuring elapsed time. This
 *    measurement reflects only the GPU device time spent executing the kernel
 *    and associated memory transfers.
 * 4. For host timing we will wrap the entire sequence (allocation, copy to device,
 *    kernel launch, copy back, deallocation) in a single call to
 *    std::chrono::high_resolution_clock. This includes host‑side overhead such as
 *    context switching, API call overhead, and the time spent waiting for the
 *    GPU to finish.
 * 5. After running a few iterations we will print both times. The CUDA event
 *    time should be noticeably smaller than the chrono time because the chrono
 *    measurement includes additional overhead.
 * 6. In the output we will also explain why CUDA events are more accurate:
 *    - They measure on the GPU timeline using the device's clock.
 *    - They only count the actual work performed by the GPU, not host overhead.
 *    - They are synchronized to the device, so they capture precise start/stop
 *      points of kernel execution and memory transfer.
 * 7. The program includes basic error checking for CUDA API calls, and it is
 *    self‑contained in a single .cu file as requested.
