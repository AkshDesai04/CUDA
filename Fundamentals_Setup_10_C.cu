/*
Aim: Add a comment explaining the role of the L2 cache in a GPU's memory hierarchy.

Thinking:
- The prompt explicitly requires a multiline comment that states the aim word‑to‑word.
- It also asks to include the entire thinking in that comment. I will describe my approach to fulfilling the prompt,
  clarifying that I will add a detailed comment about the L2 cache, then provide a minimal CUDA kernel.
- The program should compile as a .cu file and include a simple kernel for demonstration.
- I will not add any other supporting information outside the comment and the code.
- The L2 cache explanation will talk about its purpose, placement, bandwidth, latency, and how it sits between L1 and global memory.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// The L2 cache is a shared cache that resides on the GPU die between
// the per‑SM L1 caches (or unified L1/texture cache) and the global
// device memory. It serves as a secondary cache: data fetched from
// global memory that is not found in an L1 cache is stored in the L2
// cache so that subsequent requests (from any SM) can be served
// faster. The L2 cache has a larger capacity than the per‑SM L1
// caches but higher latency, thus it balances throughput and
// memory bandwidth. It helps reduce the number of slow global memory
// accesses and improves overall performance, especially for workloads
// with shared data patterns across multiple thread blocks.
