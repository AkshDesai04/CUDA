Add a comment explaining the role of the L2 cache in a GPU's memory hierarchy.

The L2 cache in a GPU is a shared, high‑speed memory tier that sits between the
global memory (device DRAM) and the L1 caches (per‑SM caches). It serves several
key purposes:

1. **Reduce Global Memory Latency** – By caching data that is accessed by
   multiple streaming multiprocessors (SMs), the L2 cache can supply data
   faster than fetching it from slower global memory.
2. **Improve Bandwidth Utilization** – Coalesced reads/writes that would otherwise
   generate many memory transactions can be satisfied by the L2 cache, thus
   reducing the number of traffic bursts on the memory bus.
3. **Provide Cache Coherence** – The L2 cache maintains coherence between
   L1 caches of different SMs, ensuring that all threads see a consistent
   view of shared data.
4. **Act as a Shared Buffer** – It buffers large data streams and aggregates
   multiple smaller accesses into fewer transactions, further optimizing
   memory throughput.

In practice, a well‑structured kernel that exploits spatial and temporal
locality can significantly benefit from the L2 cache, especially for
applications with irregular access patterns or data shared across many SMs.
