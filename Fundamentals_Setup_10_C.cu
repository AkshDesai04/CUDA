/*
Aim: Add a comment explaining the role of the L2 cache in a GPU's memory hierarchy.

Thought process:
- The prompt explicitly asks to add a comment explaining the L2 cache role. 
- The goal is to produce a .cu file containing this comment and minimal CUDA code. 
- No additional output or explanations are allowed outside the file content.
- The code will include a trivial kernel and a main function that launches it, simply to satisfy CUDA syntax.
- The comment section will contain the exact aim sentence and an explanatory comment about L2 cache.
- The L2 cache explanation: It is a shared cache among all SMs, sits between global memory and L1, reducing traffic to DRAM and providing higher bandwidth and lower latency for shared data.
- Ensure the file ends cleanly with a return statement.
