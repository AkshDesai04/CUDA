```cuda
/* 
Aim of the program:
Write a program that deliberately leaks memory on the device by allocating it but never calling `cudaFree`. Run the program multiple times and use the `nvidia-smi` command-line tool to observe how the GPU's memory usage increases.

Thinking:
- In CUDA, device memory is allocated with `cudaMalloc` and freed with `cudaFree`. 
- If we never call `cudaFree`, the allocated memory remains reserved for the lifetime of the process. 
- To observe the leak, the program will continuously allocate a fixed chunk of memory (e.g., 100â€¯MB) in an infinite loop, pausing briefly between allocations. 
- Each iteration will print the total amount of memory allocated so far, allowing the user to watch the growth in GPU memory usage via `nvidia-smi`. 
- The loop terminates when `cudaMalloc` fails (likely due to lack of free device memory). 
- This simple program demonstrates the consequences of not freeing GPU memory and how to monitor it externally.
