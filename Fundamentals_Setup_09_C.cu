Include the CUDA runtime header and standard I/O.\n2. Select a device (use device 0 for simplicity, but we could iterate).\n3. Call `cudaGetDeviceProperties` to retrieve a `cudaDeviceProp` structure.\n4. Print the device name and whether `deviceOverlap` is enabled.\n5. Handle any errors from the CUDA API calls and exit gracefully.\n\nNo kernel launch or memory copies are required for this check, so the program is\nvery short and focuses solely on the property query. This satisfies the user\'s\nrequest while keeping the code straightforward and portable. \n"""\n\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main(void) {\n    int dev = 0; // default to device 0\n    cudaDeviceProp prop;\n    cudaError_t err = cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, dev);\n    if (err != cudaSuccess) {\n        fprintf(stderr, "Failed to get device properties for device %d: %s\\n",\n                dev, cudaGetErrorString(err));\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\n    }\n\n    printf("Device %d: %s\\n", dev, prop.name);\n    printf("  Can overlap memcpy and kernel: %s\\n",\n           prop.deviceOverlap ?
