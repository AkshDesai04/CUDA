/*
Check and print if the device can overlap a `memcpy` operation with kernel execution (`deviceOverlap`).

Thinking:
- The goal is to query the CUDA device properties for the capability to overlap memory copies
  with kernel execution. This capability is indicated by the `deviceOverlap` field of
  `cudaDeviceProp`.
- We will use `cudaGetDeviceProperties` to obtain the properties for a given device (device 0).
- After retrieving the properties, we check the `deviceOverlap` flag:
  - If it is non-zero, the device can overlap memcpy with kernel execution.
  - If it is zero, it cannot.
- We will print an informative message accordingly.
- Basic error checking will be performed by verifying the return value of CUDA API calls.
- The program is a minimal standalone CUDA C program that compiles with nvcc and runs on any
  system with CUDA support.
