```cuda
/*
Aim of the program: Launch the empty kernel with a configuration of 16 blocks and 64 threads each.

Thinking process:
1. The requirement is to write a CUDA C program that launches an empty kernel. 
2. An "empty" kernel means the kernel body contains no statements; it merely exists for the sake of launching. 
3. The launch configuration must be 16 blocks and 64 threads per block, which is specified by the <<<16, 64>>> syntax. 
4. The program should be self-contained and compile as a .cu file. 
5. Include minimal error checking (cudaGetLastError after launch) to ensure correct launch. 
6. Use standard C++ headers (cstdio) for output if needed. 
7. Define the kernel with the __global__ qualifier, no parameters. 
8. In main(), launch the kernel and synchronize. 
9. Optionally print a message indicating the kernel was launched successfully. 
10. Ensure no additional text is output outside the .cu file.
