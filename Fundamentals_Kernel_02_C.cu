```cuda
/*
Aim: Modify the printf to include the thread's ID: printf("Hello from thread %d!\n", threadIdx.x);. Launch with 8 threads.

Thinking:
The task is straightforward: we need a simple CUDA kernel that prints a message including the thread's ID using device printf. Device printf requires the GPU to support compute capability 2.0 or higher. We'll launch the kernel with 1 block and 8 threads as specified. After launching, we call cudaDeviceSynchronize() to ensure all output is flushed before the program exits. Error checking is omitted for brevity but could be added if desired.
