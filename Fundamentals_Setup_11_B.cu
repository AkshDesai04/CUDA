/*
Aim: Launch the empty kernel with a configuration of 1 block and 1 thread.

Thinking:
- The requirement is to create a minimal CUDA program that launches a kernel with a single block and a single thread.
- The kernel itself is empty, performing no operations; its purpose is solely to demonstrate kernel launch mechanics.
- The host code will include the necessary headers (`cuda_runtime.h` and `stdio.h`), define the empty kernel with `__global__`, and launch it with `<<<1, 1>>>`.
- After the launch, we call `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` to ensure the kernel has finished executing before the program exits.
- Basic error checking after the kernel launch is helpful to catch any runtime issues, though for such a simple program it might be omitted.
- The program will return `0` on success.
- All the above description is included in this multiline comment to satisfy the prompt requirement.
