```cuda
/*
 * Aim of the program:
 * Launch an 8x8 block. Have only the threads on the first row (threadIdx.y == 0) print their threadIdx.x.
 *
 * Thinking:
 * - The goal is to demonstrate how to control which threads execute a certain piece of code
 *   using a condition on threadIdx.y. 
 * - We will launch a single block with dimensions 8x8. Each thread in the block has a unique
 *   pair (threadIdx.x, threadIdx.y) ranging from 0 to 7 in each dimension.
 * - Inside the kernel we use a simple if-statement: `if (threadIdx.y == 0)`. Only threads
 *   belonging to the first row (y == 0) will execute the body of the if-statement.
 * - The body contains a call to `printf` from the device. CUDA allows device-side printf
 *   starting from compute capability 2.0; the target architecture will be set accordingly
 *   during compilation. The printf will output the thread's x-index.
 * - On the host side we launch the kernel with a grid of one block and a block dimension
 *   of (8,8). After launching we call `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` to ensure all device
 *   prints are flushed before the program exits.
 * - Basic error checking is performed on the kernel launch and device synchronization to
 *   aid debugging if needed.
 * - The resulting output should show 8 lines, each indicating the x-index of the threads
 *   in the first row, i.e., 0 through 7.
