/*
 * Aim: Use `sizeof()` on the host and device to print the size of the struct and verify they are the same.
 *
 * Thinking:
 * 1. Define a simple struct `MyStruct` that contains a few fields of different types.
 * 2. On the host, use the `sizeof` operator to obtain the size of `MyStruct` and print it.
 * 3. Create a CUDA kernel that also uses `sizeof(MyStruct)` and prints the result with `printf`.
 *    - Device printf requires a compute capability of at least 2.0, which is satisfied by most
 *      modern GPUs.  The kernel is trivial and just prints the size.
 * 4. In `main()`, launch the kernel, then synchronize and check for errors.
 * 5. Use a small helper macro for CUDA error checking to keep the code clean.
 * 6. The program is selfâ€‘contained in a single .cu file; it can be compiled with `nvcc` and run on
 *    a machine with an appropriate CUDA toolkit installed.
 *
 * The output will show the size computed on the host and the size printed from the device, and
 * they should match, confirming that the struct layout is the same on both sides.
