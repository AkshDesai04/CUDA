/*
 * Aim of the program: 
 * Write a summary of why the shared memory version is faster, referencing the profiler metrics.
 *
 * Entire thinking:
 * The core idea of this program is to provide a concise explanation of the performance benefits
 * that arise when a CUDA kernel uses shared memory instead of solely relying on global memory.
 * The explanation will reference typical profiler metrics such as:
 *   - L1 and L2 cache hit/miss rates
 *   - Global memory transactions
 *   - Shared memory bank conflicts
 *   - Occupancy and instruction throughput
 *
 * Key points to cover:
 * 1. **Memory Bandwidth & Latency**:
 *    - Global memory accesses have high latency (~200–400 ns) and limited bandwidth.  
 *    - Shared memory is on‑chip (≈1 ns latency) and has higher bandwidth (tens of GB/s).  
 *    - A kernel that brings data once into shared memory and then re‑uses it for many
 *      threads reduces the number of global memory transactions dramatically.
 *
 * 2. **Profiler Metrics**:
 *    - **Global Load/Store Transactions**: Shared‑memory kernels typically show a
 *      *dramatically lower* count of these transactions in nvprof or Nsight.
 *    - **Memory Transaction Efficiency**: Coalesced accesses are preserved when data is
 *      staged into shared memory; the profiler will show a higher “memory transaction
 *      efficiency” metric.
 *    - **Cache Misses**: With shared memory, the L2 cache miss rate drops, while the
 *      L1 cache hit rate rises because the data stays in the fast on‑chip memory.
 *
 * 3. **Bank Conflict Overheads**:
 *    - If bank conflicts are minimized (by proper tiling and padding), the shared‑memory
 *      kernel can sustain a higher throughput per cycle. Profiling tools will report
 *      low bank conflict rates, whereas a purely global memory version may suffer
 *      higher conflicts due to uncoalesced accesses.
 *
 * 4. **Occupancy & Instruction Throughput**:
 *    - By reducing global memory stalls, the scheduler can keep more warps active,
 *      boosting occupancy. Nsight will show a higher “warp occupancy” metric.
 *    - The kernel can issue more ALU instructions per cycle, reflected in higher
 *      instruction throughput in the profiler.
 *
 * 5. **Practical Example**:
 *    - In a matrix‑multiply kernel, the shared‑memory version loads a tile of the
 *      matrices into shared memory once per tile. The profiler often shows the
 *      “global memory throughput” drop by ~5–10× compared to the baseline. At the
 *      same time, the “shared memory bandwidth” stays constant, indicating that the
 *      computation is now memory‑bound by the much faster shared memory.
 *
 * Conclusion:
 * The shared memory version is faster because it moves the bulk of data traffic from
 * slow, high‑latency global memory to fast, on‑chip shared memory, reducing the number
 * of memory transactions, lowering cache miss rates, and allowing the GPU to keep more
 * warps busy, which is clearly evidenced by the profiler metrics.
