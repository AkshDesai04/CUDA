```c
/* 
 * In a CUDA program that explicitly frees all allocated device memory using cudaFree (and frees any 
 * other resources such as events, streams, and kernels), calling cudaDeviceReset() is not strictly 
 * required for the program to terminate correctly.  The CUDA runtime automatically destroys the 
 * device context and frees all resources when the process exits.  However, cudaDeviceReset() has 
 * a few useful side‑effects that make it a good practice to call it at the end of a program:
 *
 * 1.  It forces the destruction of the device context in the current host thread, ensuring that 
 *     any device state (e.g., current stream, cache config, etc.) is released promptly.  This is 
 *     particularly important for long‑running host applications that create and destroy many 
 *     contexts over time, as it helps avoid context leakage.
 *
 * 2.  It performs a clean shutdown of the GPU, flushing all pending work and ensuring that 
 *     subsequent runs start from a clean state.  This can be useful for debugging tools that 
 *     track GPU state or for when you want to reuse the same GPU for other applications without 
 *     waiting for the OS to reclaim the context.
 *
 * 3.  It makes the program’s termination deterministic.  If a program exits without calling 
 *     cudaDeviceReset(), the operating system will reclaim the GPU resources, but the timing 
 *     of that reclamation is non‑deterministic, which may cause subtle issues in environments 
 *     that run many GPU jobs back‑to‑back (e.g., continuous integration pipelines).
 *
 * In short, while cudaFree() (and other CUDA cleanup functions) are sufficient for a clean exit, 
 * calling cudaDeviceReset() is a good defensive practice for robustness, reproducibility, and 
 * clarity, especially in complex or long‑running host programs.  If the program is a short 
 * standalone executable that simply launches kernels and exits, the call is optional and can be 
 * omitted without affecting correctness.  */
