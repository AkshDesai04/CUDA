**Pros of using exceptions:**

1. **Granular error propagation**  
   - Exceptions allow you to throw an error from a deep function call and catch it at a higher level, preserving the call stack and making it easier to pinpoint where the problem originated.

2. **Separation of error‑handling logic**  
   - The normal execution path remains uncluttered; error‑handling code is isolated in `catch` blocks.

3. **Flexible recovery**  
   - Depending on the type of exception, you can attempt to recover (e.g., retry a kernel launch, reallocate resources) instead of terminating the program.

4. **Structured and type‑safe**  
   - Custom exception types can carry rich context (error code, message, CUDA error details) without requiring manual string or code parsing.

5. **Integration with C++ RAII**  
   - When combined with C++ objects, exceptions work seamlessly with destructors that clean up resources (CUDA memory, streams, events, etc.).

**Cons of using exceptions:**

1. **Limited CUDA support**  
   - CUDA kernels cannot throw C++ exceptions. Exceptions are only usable on the host side (unless you use C++11 `std::terminate`‑style error handling in device code, which is not standard).

2. **Performance overhead**  
   - Throwing and catching exceptions can add overhead, particularly if used frequently or in tight loops. The cost may be noticeable in performance‑critical sections.

3. **Complexity in mixed codebases**  
   - Mixing C and C++ code or older CUDA libraries that use `cudaGetLastError()` and error codes can lead to inconsistent error‑handling strategies.

4. **Potential for uncaught exceptions**  
   - If an exception propagates past the intended catch block, it may terminate the program or leave resources leaked if not handled properly.

5. **Thread and device boundaries**  
   - CUDA launch failures or device errors are asynchronous and may not be immediately detectable on the host, making exception handling less straightforward.

**Pros of using `exit()`:**

1. **Simplicity**  
   - A single call to `exit()` (or `std::exit()`) stops program execution immediately, making the error path straightforward.

2. **No overhead**  
   - There is no cost associated with exception handling machinery; the program terminates as soon as the error is detected.

3. **Consistent behavior across hosts and devices**  
   - `exit()` can be called in both host and device code (although device `exit()` terminates the kernel, not the host program), providing a unified error‑shutdown mechanism.

4. **No need for exception‑safe code**  
   - You don’t have to worry about destructors, stack unwinding, or catching the exception in the right place.

**Cons of using `exit()`:**

1. **Hard to recover**  
   - The program terminates immediately, so any attempt to retry, fallback, or cleanly deallocate resources is impossible.

2. **Resource leaks**  
   - `exit()` bypasses normal stack unwinding; unless you manually clean up (e.g., in a `atexit` handler), CUDA resources (memory, streams, events) may remain allocated until the OS reclaims them.

3. **Limited debugging information**  
   - While you can print an error message, the call stack is not automatically preserved, making it harder to trace the error source.

4. **Poor integration with RAII**  
   - Since destructors aren’t run, RAII‑based resource management fails, potentially leaving CUDA objects dangling.

5. **Inconsistent error semantics**  
   - Using `exit()` for all errors mixes fatal errors (e.g., hardware failures) with recoverable ones (e.g., transient kernel launch failure), which can be confusing.

### Bottom line for CUDA applications

- **Use exceptions for host‑side, recoverable errors** where you want fine‑grained control and integration with C++ RAII.  
- **Use `exit()` (or `cudaDeviceReset()` followed by `exit()`) only for unrecoverable, catastrophic failures** (e.g., no GPU available, invalid context).  

In practice, a hybrid approach works best: check CUDA API return codes, log detailed diagnostics, and either throw a C++ exception for recoverable conditions or call `cudaDeviceReset(); exit(EXIT_FAILURE);` for fatal ones.
