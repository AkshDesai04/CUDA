**Pros of using exceptions**

1. **Granular error handling** – Exceptions can carry rich information (error codes, messages, context) and can be caught at different levels of the call stack, allowing the program to recover or take alternative actions.
2. **Separation of concerns** – The core logic can be written without interleaving error‑checking code, keeping it cleaner and more maintainable.
3. **Stack unwinding** – On the host side, throwing an exception triggers automatic stack unwinding, which can run destructors and release resources properly.
4. **Interoperability** – If you are using a C++ CUDA runtime or libraries that already use exceptions, it is natural to adopt the same error‑handling paradigm.

**Cons of using exceptions**

1. **Limited GPU support** – CUDA device code (kernels) cannot throw or catch C++ exceptions. Even host code that calls device functions must use `cudaGetLastError()` or similar checks. Thus, exceptions cannot be used to propagate errors from the GPU directly.
2. **Performance overhead** – Throwing/catching exceptions involves additional stack manipulation and can increase binary size and runtime overhead, especially if exceptions are used frequently.
3. **Complexity with mixed C/C++** – In a large project that mixes C and C++ or uses CUDA’s C API, introducing exceptions may require refactoring and careful handling of `extern "C"` boundaries.
4. **Debugging difficulty** – When exceptions are swallowed or not handled correctly, the program may terminate silently, making it harder to diagnose the cause.

**Pros of using `exit()` (or `return` + error codes)**

1. **Simplicity** – Calling `exit()` immediately terminates the program with a clear exit status, making the error path straightforward.
2. **No runtime overhead** – No exception machinery is invoked, which keeps the binary lean and the execution fast.
3. **Compatibility** – Works uniformly in C, C++, host and device code. Device code can call `cudaDeviceReset()` and then `exit()` via the host wrapper if needed.
4. **Deterministic termination** – Guarantees that the program stops, avoiding further undefined behavior after a fatal error.

**Cons of using `exit()`**

1. **No recovery** – The program cannot attempt alternative actions or cleanup beyond what `atexit()` handlers or destructors run; you lose fine‑grained control over error handling.
2. **Resource leaks** – If the program exits abruptly, dynamically allocated resources or open file descriptors may not be released cleanly.
3. **Harder testing** – Unit tests that intentionally trigger errors may be difficult to write because the test harness would terminate on `exit()`.
4. **Less expressive** – `exit()` typically only provides an integer status code; conveying detailed error information requires additional mechanisms (e.g., logging), which must be handled manually.

**Choosing between the two**

- **Use exceptions** when you need rich, recoverable error handling on the host side, especially in a C++‑centric codebase that already leverages exceptions for other errors.  
- **Use `exit()` or explicit error codes** for fatal, unrecoverable errors (e.g., failed CUDA context creation, out‑of‑memory conditions) where a graceful shutdown is preferable and you want to keep the code simple and efficient.

In practice, a common pattern is to wrap CUDA API calls in helper functions that check the returned `cudaError_t`. For recoverable errors, throw a C++ exception; for unrecoverable ones, log the error and call `exit()` or `cudaDeviceReset()` followed by `exit()`. This hybrid approach combines the expressiveness of exceptions with the safety of immediate termination for truly fatal situations.
