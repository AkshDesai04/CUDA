/*
Aim: Write code that triggers an asynchronous error. Show that the API call itself returns `cudaSuccess` but `cudaDeviceSynchronize` later returns an error.

Thinking:
To demonstrate an asynchronous error, we will launch a kernel that intentionally writes outside the bounds of a device array. CUDA launches kernels asynchronously, meaning the launch call (`errorKernel<<<1,32>>>`) will return `cudaSuccess` even though the kernel will later encounter an illegal memory access. The error will not be reported until a synchronization point, such as `cudaDeviceSynchronize()`, is reached. At that point, the runtime will detect the illegal address and return an error code (e.g., `cudaErrorIllegalAddress`). We will allocate a very small array on the device (size 1) and launch the kernel with 32 threads, causing an out-of-bounds write for threads with index >=1. The code will print the result of the kernel launch and the result of the subsequent synchronization to illustrate the asynchronous nature of the error.
