```cuda
/*
Write code that triggers an asynchronous error. Show that the API call itself returns `cudaSuccess` but `cudaDeviceSynchronize` later returns an error.

Thinking Process:
1. The goal is to demonstrate that a CUDA kernel launch can return cudaSuccess even though an error occurs during kernel execution. This is a classic asynchronous error scenario: the error is not detected until synchronization.
2. We need a simple kernel that performs an illegal operation, such as division by zero, which will trigger a runtime error on the device.
3. The kernel launch itself is an asynchronous operation. The CUDA Runtime API returns a status for the launch, but that status only reflects launch configuration errors (e.g., invalid grid/block dimensions). It will not catch errors that occur inside the kernel.
4. After launching the kernel, we call cudaDeviceSynchronize to force the host to wait for the kernel to finish. At this point, the runtime will propagate the device-side error.
5. The program will print the status returned by the kernel launch (expected: cudaSuccess) and the status returned by cudaDeviceSynchronize (expected: an error like cudaErrorLaunchFailure or cudaErrorIllegalAddress).
6. We also allocate a small device array to pass to the kernel; the kernel uses it only to write a value, but the illegal operation is what triggers the error.

This code compiles with nvcc and demonstrates the requested behavior.
