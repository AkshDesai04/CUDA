Using `cudaMalloc` followed by `cudaMemcpy` for a 2‑D array means you are treating the array as a single contiguous block of memory that you allocate and copy in one shot. This works because the host representation is laid out in a simple row‑major (or column‑major) order and the device receives the same linear byte stream.

However, this approach is often sub‑optimal for performance because:

1. **Non‑aligned memory rows** – CUDA prefers each row of a 2‑D image to start at a memory address that is a multiple of a *pitch* (often 256 or 512 bytes). When you allocate a flat block, each row ends exactly where the previous one ended, which can leave the next row misaligned relative to the device’s cache lines. This misalignment forces the GPU to fetch data from two different memory transactions instead of one, reducing bandwidth utilization.

2. **Cache line padding** – Pitched allocations automatically pad each row to the next multiple of the required alignment. This padding allows each row to be accessed as a unit, improving coalesced memory access patterns for threads that are processing a row or a tile. A flat allocation can cause neighboring rows to share cache lines, which leads to false sharing and increased memory traffic.

3. **Device code complexity** – When you use pitched memory you can use the `texture`/`surface` API or directly index into a 2‑D array with `row * pitch + col`. The compiler and hardware can then generate more efficient loads. With a flat block you must calculate `row * width + col` yourself, and if the width is not a power of two you may end up with extra arithmetic that slows the kernel.

4. **Kernel launch efficiency** – If a kernel processes a 2‑D grid (e.g., one thread per element), pitched memory lets the kernel read an entire row in one transaction. A flat allocation forces the kernel to read each element individually, potentially breaking the coalescing rules and increasing the number of memory transactions.

5. **Memory fragmentation** – On the device side, a flat allocation may lead to fragmentation if the array is large and the device memory pool is fragmented. Pitched allocations are more flexible because they let the CUDA runtime find a block that satisfies both the width and pitch constraints.

In short, while a flat `cudaMalloc` + `cudaMemcpy` works, it can lead to misaligned rows, poor cache usage, more memory transactions, and extra arithmetic overhead in the kernel. Using the pitch/2‑D versions (`cudaMallocPitch`, `cudaMemcpy2D`, etc.) aligns rows to cache boundaries, allows the hardware to coalesce accesses, and ultimately gives better performance.
