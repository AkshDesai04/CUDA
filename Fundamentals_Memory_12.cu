```cpp
/* 
Aim of the program (as passed in the prompt word for word): 
Write a C++ wrapper class for device memory. The constructor should accept a size, call `cudaMalloc`, and store the pointer. The destructor should call `cudaFree`. This is a basic implementation of the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principle for CUDA pointers.

Thinking process:
1. The goal is to provide a RAII wrapper that manages device memory automatically, ensuring that memory is freed when the object goes out of scope.
2. The wrapper will store a `void*` pointer to the device memory and the requested size (for potential debugging or future extensions).
3. The constructor takes the size in bytes, calls `cudaMalloc`, and checks the return status. If allocation fails, it throws a C++ exception (std::runtime_error) with an informative message.
4. The destructor calls `cudaFree` on the stored pointer, but only if it is nonâ€‘null.
5. Copy semantics are disabled to avoid double free. Move semantics are provided to allow ownership transfer.
6. For demonstration, a simple `main` function allocates a buffer, prints the device pointer, and then exits, causing the destructor to run.
7. The file is a .cu file, suitable for compilation with `nvcc`. All required headers (`cuda_runtime.h`, `iostream`, `stdexcept`) are included.
8. Error handling is minimal but sufficient for illustration; real code might use more sophisticated error handling or a helper macro.
