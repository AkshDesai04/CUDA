/*
Trigger the error by passing a `nullptr` for the pointer-to-a-pointer in `cudaMalloc` (`cudaMalloc(nullptr, 100)`).

Thinking: The goal of this program is to demonstrate how CUDA handles an invalid argument in cudaMalloc by deliberately passing a null pointer as the destination address pointer. According to the CUDA Runtime API, the first argument to cudaMalloc must be a valid pointer to a void* variable where the device memory address will be stored. Supplying a nullptr violates this contract, and CUDA should return an error code (CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE). The program will call cudaMalloc with nullptr, capture the returned error code, and print the human-readable error message using cudaGetErrorString. This minimal example is compiled as a .cu file and can be run with nvcc. It is intentionally simple, focusing solely on triggering and reporting the error. No other functionality or resource cleanup is necessary because the allocation never succeeds. The output will confirm that the error was correctly detected.

    std::cout << "Error message: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;

    return 0;
