What values does the kernel see when it reads from the struct\'s members?`\n\n""" \nThe task is to demonstrate the effect of passing a pointer to a struct to a CUDA kernel without copying the host data to the device first. In the program, we:\n\n1. Define a simple struct `MyStruct` with an `int` and a `float` member.\n2. On the host, we create an instance of `MyStruct` and initialize its members.\n3. Allocate device memory for a `MyStruct` pointer but deliberately skip `cudaMemcpy` from host to device.\n4. Launch a kernel that receives the device pointer, dereferences it, and prints the values of the struct members using device `printf`.\n5. After the kernel finishes, we copy the struct back to host memory (optional) and print the values again to see what the device observed.\n6. No error checking is added to keep the code minimal; the focus is on illustrating that the kernel sees uninitialized (garbage) values because the host data was never transferred.\n"""\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\nstruct MyStruct {\n    int   a;\n    float b;\n};\n\n__global__ void readStructKernel(MyStruct *s) {\n    printf("Kernel reads: a = %d, b = %f\\n", s->a, s->b);\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    // Host struct with initialized values\n    MyStruct h_struct;\n    h_struct.a = 42;\n    h_struct.b = 3.14f;\n\n    // Allocate device memory for the struct\n    MyStruct *d_struct;\n    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_struct, sizeof(MyStruct));\n\n    // Intentionally omit cudaMemcpy to simulate forgotten copy\n\n    // Launch kernel\n    readStructKernel<<<1, 1>>>(d_struct);\n    cudaDeviceSynchronize();\n\n    // Copy back to host (optional, just to show what device had)\n    MyStruct h_back;\n    cudaMemcpy(&h_back, d_struct, sizeof(MyStruct), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);\n    printf("Host after kernel: a = %d, b = %f\\n", h_back.a, h_back.b);\n\n    // Clean up\n    cudaFree(d_struct);\n    return 0;\n}\n', images=None, tool_calls=None)
