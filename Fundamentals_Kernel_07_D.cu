Have each thread print its 3D thread index (threadIdx.x, threadIdx.y, threadIdx.z)`\n\n""" \nWe need to create a simple CUDA program that launches a single block of size (4,4,4) threads and has each thread print its 3D thread index. \nCUDA supports device-side printf from compute capability 2.0 and above. We will use a kernel that calls printf for each thread. \nAfter launching the kernel, we synchronize the device to ensure all prints are flushed before the program exits. \nNo additional memory allocation is required. \n"""\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n__global__ void printThreadIdx()\n{\n    printf("Block [%d, %d, %d] Thread [%d, %d, %d]\\n",\n           blockIdx.x, blockIdx.y, blockIdx.z,\n           threadIdx.x, threadIdx.y, threadIdx.z);\n}\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    dim3 blockDim(4, 4, 4);\n    dim3 gridDim(1, 1, 1);\n\n    printThreadIdx<<<gridDim, blockDim>>>();\n    cudaDeviceSynchronize();\n\n    return 0;\n}\n', images=None, tool_calls=None)
