The bandwidth for a PCI‑Express DMA transfer is essentially symmetrical, so a device‑to‑host copy (`cudaMemcpy(d, h, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost)`) will normally take about the same amount of time as a host‑to‑device copy, provided you use pinned (page‑locked) host memory in both cases. In practice the device‑to‑host transfer can be a little slower because the data must arrive in slower system RAM and because the CUDA driver may prefer to keep the copy kernel on the GPU side for host‑to‑device. However the difference is usually small—on the order of a few percent—so for most purposes the two directions are considered to have comparable performance.
