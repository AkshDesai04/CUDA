```cpp
/*
Aim of the program: Trigger `cudaErrorInvalidConfiguration` by using a 2D block size where one of the dimensions exceeds the device limit (e.g., `dim3 block(2048, 1, 1)`).

Thinking:
1. According to CUDA device properties, the maximum number of threads per block is typically 1024. This limit applies to the total number of threads, but also to individual dimension limits (e.g., `maxThreadsDim.x`).
2. By setting a block dimension that exceeds this limit, such as `dim3 block(2048, 1, 1)`, the kernel launch will be rejected by the runtime with the error `cudaErrorInvalidConfiguration`.
3. The program will launch a trivial kernel that does nothing. After the launch, we will query the last error and print its string representation to confirm that the expected error was produced.
4. The code will use the CUDA runtime API (`cuda_runtime.h`) for simplicity. We will include minimal error checking for device initialization and kernel launch.
5. The program will compile to a `.cu` file and run on any CUDA-capable device, consistently generating the invalid configuration error because the block size violates hardware limits.
