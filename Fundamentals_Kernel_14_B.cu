```cuda
/*
The aim of the program is to trigger `cudaErrorInvalidConfiguration` by using a 2D block size where one of the dimensions exceeds the device limit (e.g., `dim3 block(2048, 1, 1)`).

My thinking process:

1. Understand that CUDA kernel launch configuration is specified by a grid size and a block size.
2. The block size must not exceed device limits such as the maximum number of threads per block and maximum dimension sizes (e.g., 1024 threads per block on many GPUs).
3. Intentionally set a block dimension that violates these limits: `dim3 block(2048, 1, 1)`. This will produce an invalid configuration error when launching the kernel.
4. Include a simple kernel that does nothing; the focus is on the launch error.
5. In the host code, launch the kernel with the oversized block size.
6. Immediately after the launch, use `cudaGetLastError()` to capture any error returned by the launch.
7. Print the error code and error string to demonstrate that `cudaErrorInvalidConfiguration` has been triggered.
8. Keep the code minimal but compilable, using standard CUDA runtime API calls.
