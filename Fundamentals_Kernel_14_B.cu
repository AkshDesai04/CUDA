```cuda
/*
Trigger `cudaErrorInvalidConfiguration` by using a 2D block size where one of the dimensions exceeds the device limit (e.g., `dim3 block(2048, 1, 1)`).

Thinking process:
1. The CUDA runtime limits the maximum number of threads per block, typically 1024 on most GPUs.
2. By setting a block dimension that exceeds this limit (2048 in the x-dimension), we force the runtime to reject the kernel launch.
3. The kernel itself does not need to perform any work; its sole purpose is to trigger the error.
4. After launching the kernel, we call `cudaGetLastError()` to capture the error code and print it to standard output.
5. This program will compile with `nvcc` and when executed on a typical GPU, will print `cudaErrorInvalidConfiguration` (code 11).
