The other threads finish. Does the block as a whole ever finish? (No, requires all threads to finish).`\n\n""" \nWe need a minimal CUDA program that launches a kernel in which only thread 0 spins forever, while all other threads return normally. The host will launch the kernel and call cudaDeviceSynchronize() to wait for completion. Since thread 0 never exits, the block never finishes and the synchronize call never returns, so the program hangs. This demonstrates that a blockâ€™s execution completes only when all threads in the block have finished. \n\nKey points:\n- Use a simple kernel with a conditional infinite loop for threadIdx.x == 0.\n- Use a small number of threads (e.g., 32) to illustrate the block structure.\n- Add basic error checking after kernel launch.\n- Include a comment explaining that the program will not finish.\n\nThe code is fully self-contained and can be compiled with nvcc. \n"""\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n__global__ void infiniteLoopKernel()\n{\n    // Thread 0 will spin forever\n    if (threadIdx.x == 0) {\n        while (true) {\n            // Busy wait\n        }\n    }\n    // All other threads exit immediately\n}\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // Launch one block with 32 threads\n    infiniteLoopKernel<<<1, 32>>>();\n\n    // Check for launch errors\n    cudaError_t err = cudaGetLastError();\n    if (err != cudaSuccess) {\n        fprintf(stderr, "Kernel launch failed: %s\\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // Wait for the kernel to finish (it will never finish because thread 0 loops forever)\n    err = cudaDeviceSynchronize();\n    if (err != cudaSuccess) {\n        fprintf(stderr, "cudaDeviceSynchronize failed: %s\\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // This line is never reached\n    printf("Kernel completed.\\n");\n    return 0;\n}\n', images=None, tool_calls=None)
