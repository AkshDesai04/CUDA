Calling the error‑checking routine only once, at the very end of the program, defeats many of the advantages that a quick “check” provides during CUDA development:

1. **Asynchronous execution** – CUDA kernels and memory copies are launched asynchronously. The error status set by a particular launch isn’t reflected until a subsequent synchronous call (e.g., a `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` or another kernel launch) or until the program terminates. If you wait until the end, you might never notice that a particular kernel failed; the failure could surface later when you read data back or launch another kernel.

2. **Loss of context** – When you check immediately after each launch you know *exactly* which operation produced the error. If you defer the check, you lose that context. The final check will only tell you that *something* went wrong, but it will be unclear whether it was the first kernel, a later memory copy, or a device‑synchronization failure.

3. **Early exit and debugging speed** – Detecting an error early allows you to stop the program immediately, saving time that would otherwise be spent running the rest of the workload. If you only check at the end, you may waste hours of GPU time on kernels that would never have succeeded, making the debugging cycle unnecessarily long.

4. **Hidden race conditions and data corruption** – A failure in an early kernel may corrupt device memory. Subsequent kernels will then read or write corrupted data, potentially causing different errors that mask the original problem. Checking after each step prevents cascading corruption.

5. **Complex programs with many launches** – In real applications you often launch dozens of kernels and perform many memory transfers. If you only check at the end, you must sift through all intermediate results to locate the offending call. Immediate checks turn this into a linear, incremental process that is much easier to follow.

In short, a single “check at the end” gives you only a vague sense that something went wrong. Frequent, fine‑grained checks let you catch errors right where they occur, preserve useful debugging information, and keep the debugging cycle short and reliable.
