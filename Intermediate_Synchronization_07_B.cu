```cpp
/*
The lock release can be a simple `*lock_ptr = 0;`, but it should be a volatile write to ensure visibility: `*((volatile int*)lock_ptr) = 0;` or `atomicExch(lock_ptr, 0)`.

In this program we implement a simple spinlock for CUDA device code. The lock is represented by an integer in device memory. The acquire function uses atomicCAS to set the lock from 0 to 1, spinning until the lock becomes available. The release function writes 0 back to the lock using a volatile write to guarantee that all threads see the release before any subsequent operations. An alternative release method using atomicExch is also shown but commented out.

The kernel demonstrates the lock by protecting a critical section where a global counter is incremented. Each thread attempts to acquire the lock, increments the counter, and releases the lock. After kernel execution we copy the counter back to host memory and print the final value, which should equal the number of times the critical section was entered.
