/*
Aim: Launch with a 3D grid of (2, 2, 2) blocks, each with one thread. Have each thread print its `blockIdx.x`, `blockIdx.y`, and `blockIdx.z`.

Thinking:
1. We need a CUDA kernel that runs one thread per block, so `blockDim = dim3(1)`.
2. The grid is 3D with dimensions (2, 2, 2) â†’ `gridDim = dim3(2, 2, 2)`.
3. Inside the kernel, use `printf` (device-side) to output the block indices.  
   This requires `#include <stdio.h>` and compiling with `nvcc` which automatically enables device printf.
4. After launching the kernel, call `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` to ensure all prints are flushed to the console before the program exits.
5. Add simple error checking after the kernel launch and synchronization for robustness.
