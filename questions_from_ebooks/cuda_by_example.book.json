What are the advantages/disadvantages of using a mutex versus an atomic add in this scenario?  (Answer: Atomic add is often faster for simple accumulation, but can become a bottleneck if contention is very high.  Mutex offers more flexibility but has overhead.  The best choice depends on the specific hardware and workload.)",
