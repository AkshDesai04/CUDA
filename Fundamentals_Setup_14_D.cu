Allocate host and device memory for two input arrays and an output array.\n2. Create a CUDA stream.\n3. Copy the input arrays to the device asynchronously on that stream.\n4. Launch a simple vector‑addition kernel on the same stream.\n5. Copy the result back to the host asynchronously on the same stream.\n6. Synchronize the stream before verifying the results.\n7. Clean up all resources.\n\nThe key comment will be placed right after the stream creation, describing that a stream is a sequence of operations that execute in order on the GPU, and that multiple streams can run concurrently, enabling overlapping of memory copies and kernel executions. The rest of the code is a minimal, self‑contained example that compiles and runs with nvcc. \n"""\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n// Simple vector addition kernel\n__global__ void addKernel(const float *a, const float *b, float *c, int N) {\n    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;\n    if (i < N) c[i] = a[i] + b[i];\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    const int N = 1 << 20;                 // 1M elements\n    const size_t bytes = N * sizeof(float);\n\n    // Allocate host memory\n    float *h_a = (float*)malloc(bytes);\n    float *h_b = (float*)malloc(bytes);\n    float *h_c = (float*)malloc(bytes);\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {\n        h_a[i] = (float)i;\n        h_b[i] = (float)(2 * i);\n    }\n\n    // Allocate device memory\n    float *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;\n    cudaMalloc(&d_a, bytes);\n    cudaMalloc(&d_b, bytes);\n    cudaMalloc(&d_c, bytes);\n\n    // Create a CUDA stream\n    cudaStream_t stream;\n    cudaStreamCreate(&stream);\n\n    // A CUDA stream is a sequence of operations that execute in order on the GPU.\n    // Multiple streams can run concurrently, allowing overlapping of memory copies and kernel executions.\n    // Here we launch kernel and copies in this stream to enable potential overlap with other streams.\n\n    // Asynchronously copy inputs to device\n    cudaMemcpyAsync(d_a, h_a, bytes, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream);\n    cudaMemcpyAsync(d_b, h_b, bytes, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream);\n\n    // Launch kernel on the stream\n    const int threads = 256;\n    const int blocks = (N + threads - 1) / threads;\n    addKernel<<<blocks, threads, 0, stream>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, N);\n\n    // Asynchronously copy result back to host\n    cudaMemcpyAsync(h_c, d_c, bytes, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost, stream);\n\n    // Wait for all operations in the stream to complete\n    cudaStreamSynchronize(stream);\n\n    // Verify results\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {\n        if (h_c[i] != h_a[i] + h_b[i]) {\n            printf("Mismatch at %d: %f != %f + %f\\n", i, h_c[i], h_a[i], h_b[i]);\n            return -1;\n        }\n    }\n    printf("Vector addition successful.\\n");\n\n    // Clean up\n    cudaStreamDestroy(stream);\n    cudaFree(d_a); cudaFree(d_b); cudaFree(d_c);\n    free(h_a); free(h_b); free(h_c);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n', images=None, tool_calls=None)
