/* 
Aim: Write a program that checks `cudaDeviceCanAccessPeer` with an invalid peer device index.

Thinking:
- The goal is to demonstrate how CUDA handles an attempt to query peer access for a device index that does not exist.
- We first query the number of CUDA-capable devices using `cudaGetDeviceCount`. 
- For simplicity, we select device 0 as the calling device. In a real-world scenario we might iterate over all devices, but the prompt only requires checking one.
- We then construct an invalid peer index. The simplest invalid index is equal to the number of devices (since valid indices are 0 to N-1). 
  - If there is only one device, the invalid index will be 1, which is out of range.
  - If there are multiple devices, any index >= N is invalid.
- We set the current device to device 0 with `cudaSetDevice(0)` so that subsequent device queries operate on the correct device.
- The call to `cudaDeviceCanAccessPeer` will attempt to determine whether device 0 can access the peer at the invalid index. According to the CUDA Runtime API, this should return an error such as `cudaErrorInvalidDevice` or a similar error code, because the peer index is out of bounds.
- We will capture the returned error code and print it along with its string representation using `cudaGetErrorString`. 
- For completeness, we also check the value of the `access` flag; if the call erroneously succeeded, we would print the flag value, but we expect an error.
- Basic error checking is implemented via the macro `checkCudaErr` to abort execution if a CUDA call returns anything other than `cudaSuccess`. 
- The program outputs the result of the `cudaDeviceCanAccessPeer` call, demonstrating that an invalid peer index results in an error as expected.

The code below follows this reasoning and is self-contained: compile with `nvcc` and run on a machine with at least one CUDA-capable GPU.
