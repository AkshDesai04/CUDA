```cuda
/*
Aim of the program:
Modify the kernel so each thread prints `gridDim.x - 1 - blockIdx.x` (its block index from the end of the grid).

Thinking process:
1. The kernel will use `printf` to output the calculated value.
2. The calculation `gridDim.x - 1 - blockIdx.x` gives the reverse block index, i.e., how many blocks are after the current one.
3. Each thread in a block will print the same value because it depends only on blockIdx.x.
4. The host code will launch the kernel with a few blocks and threads per block to demonstrate the output.
5. We need to include `<stdio.h>` and compile with `nvcc -arch=sm_XX` where XX is your GPU capability.
6. The output will be printed to the console; ensure that device-side `printf` is allowed (i.e., use `-arch=sm_35` or higher).
