This capability is crucial for performance and is indicated by the asyncEngineCount property (a value > 0).`\n\n""" \nTo determine whether the primary GPU supports overlapping data transfer with kernel execution, we query the device\'s properties via cudaGetDeviceProperties. The asyncEngineCount field indicates the number of asynchronous copy engines available; a value greater than zero means the GPU can perform copies concurrently with kernels.\n\nThe program will:\n1. Get the current device (primary GPU).\n2. Retrieve its cudaDeviceProp structure.\n3. Print the asyncEngineCount value.\n4. Output a human‑readable message indicating whether overlapping is supported.\n\nA simple error‑checking macro is included for robustness. No kernel launches are necessary for this diagnostic; we just interrogate the hardware capability. The code is a self‑contained CUDA C program suitable for compilation with nvcc and execution on a machine with an appropriate GPU. \n"""\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n#define CUDA_CHECK(call)                                              \\\n    do {                                                              \\\n        cudaError_t err = call;                                       \\\n        if (err != cudaSuccess) {                                     \\\n            fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error at %s:%d: %s\\n",              \\\n                    __FILE__, __LINE__, cudaGetErrorString(err));     \\\n            return EXIT_FAILURE;                                      \\\n        }                                                             \\\n    } while (0)\n\nint main(void) {\n    int device = 0; // primary GPU\n    cudaDeviceProp prop;\n\n    CUDA_CHECK(cudaGetDevice(&device));\n    CUDA_CHECK(cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, device));\n\n    printf("Device %d: %s\\n", device, prop.name);\n    printf("asyncEngineCount: %d\\n", prop.asyncEngineCount);\n\n    if (prop.asyncEngineCount > 0) {\n        printf("GPU can overlap data copy with kernel execution.\\n");\n    } else {\n        printf("GPU cannot overlap data copy with kernel execution.\\n");\n    }\n\n    return EXIT_SUCCESS;\n}', images=None, tool_calls=None)
