A warp consists of 32 threads.\n2. Each streaming multiprocessor (SM) can have a maximum number of active threads simultaneously, given by `deviceProp.maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor`. This value is available from `cudaDeviceProp`.\n3. The theoretical maximum number of warps that can run concurrently on a single SM is therefore `maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor / 32`. This assumes no other resource constraints (registers, shared memory, etc.) limit the number of active warps; it\'s purely a theoretical limit based on the thread count per SM.\n4. The GPU has a certain number of SMs, available from `deviceProp.multiProcessorCount`.\n5. Thus, the theoretical maximum number of concurrent warps for the entire GPU is:\n   ```\n   total_warps = multiProcessorCount * (maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor / 32)\n   ```\n\nImplementation steps:\n\n- Include the necessary headers: `<stdio.h>` and `<cuda_runtime.h>`.\n- Define a simple `CUDA_CHECK` macro to simplify error checking after CUDA API calls.\n- In `main`:\n  - Query the number of CUDA-capable devices (`cudaGetDeviceCount`). If none, exit.\n  - Use device 0 for simplicity. (In a multi-GPU system, one could extend this to iterate over all devices, but the prompt asks for the entire GPU, implying a single GPU context.)\n  - Get the device properties with `cudaGetDeviceProperties`.\n  - Compute `warps_per_sm = deviceProp.maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor / 32`.\n  - Compute `total_warps = deviceProp.multiProcessorCount * warps_per_sm`.\n  - Print the result in a readable format, e.g. “Theoretical maximum concurrent warps: X”.\n- The program is minimal and self-contained; no kernel launch is needed.\n\nThis program can be compiled with `nvcc` and executed on any system with a CUDA-capable GPU to print the desired theoretical maximum concurrent warps. \n\nThe code follows all required guidelines: a complete, compilable CUDA C file, with error checking, and only prints the calculated value. \n\nNow provide the code. \n"""\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n#define CUDA_CHECK(call)                                               \\\n    do {                                                               \\\n        cudaError_t err = call;                                        \\\n        if (err != cudaSuccess) {                                      \\\n            fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error in %s (%s:%d): %s\\n",          \\\n                    #call, __FILE__, __LINE__, cudaGetErrorString(err));\\\n            return EXIT_FAILURE;                                       \\\n        }                                                              \\\n    } while (0)\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    int deviceCount = 0;\n    CUDA_CHECK(cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount));\n\n    if (deviceCount == 0) {\n        fprintf(stderr, "No CUDA-capable devices found.\\n");\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\n    }\n\n    int device = 0; // Use the first device\n    cudaDeviceProp prop;\n    CUDA_CHECK(cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, device));\n\n    // Compute theoretical maximum concurrent warps\n    int maxThreadsPerSM = prop.maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor;\n    int warpsPerSM = maxThreadsPerSM / 32; // Warp size is 32\n    int totalSMs = prop.multiProcessorCount;\n    int totalWarps = totalSMs * warpsPerSM;\n\n    printf("Device %d: %s\\n", device, prop.name);\n    printf("  Multi-Processor Count        : %d\\n", totalSMs);\n    printf("  Max Threads Per SM           : %d\\n", maxThreadsPerSM);\n    printf("  Warps Per SM (theoretical)   : %d\\n", warpsPerSM);\n    printf("Total theoretical maximum concurrent warps: %d\\n", totalWarps);\n\n    return EXIT_SUCCESS;\n}\n', images=None, tool_calls=None)
