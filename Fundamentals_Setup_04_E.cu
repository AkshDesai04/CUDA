/*
Aim of the program: Calculate and print the theoretical maximum number of concurrent warps the entire GPU can run.

Thinking:
- On a CUDA-capable GPU, the total theoretical concurrent warps that can be active at a time is determined by the number of Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) and the maximum number of threads that can be resident on each SM.
- Each warp consists of 32 threads (warpSize). The maximum number of threads that can reside on an SM is given by the device property maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor.
- Therefore, the maximum number of warps that can be resident on one SM is:
        maxWarpsPerSM = maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor / warpSize
  (Since warpSize is always a divisor of maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor for supported GPUs, integer division is safe.)
- The theoretical maximum number of concurrent warps for the whole GPU is then:
        maxConcurrentWarps = numMultiProcessors * maxWarpsPerSM
- We will query the device properties using cudaGetDeviceProperties and compute this value for the default device (device 0). The program will handle errors gracefully and print the result in a humanâ€‘readable format.
- No kernel launch is necessary; we only need the device properties. The program is written in standard C++ with CUDA runtime API.
