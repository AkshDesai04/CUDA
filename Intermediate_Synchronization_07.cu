Aim of the program:
Implement a simple spin-lock in global memory using `atomicCAS` (Compare-And-Swap). 
A thread tries to acquire the lock by swapping a 0 to a 1. 
If it succeeds, it enters a critical section. 
It releases the lock by writing 0 back. 
(Note: This is often inefficient on GPUs but is a good exercise).

Thought process and design decisions:
1. I decided to use `__managed__` variables for the lock and the shared counter. 
   This eliminates the need to explicitly allocate and copy data between host and device.
2. The lock is an integer where 0 means unlocked and 1 means locked. 
   A thread attempts to acquire the lock by calling `atomicCAS(&lock, 0, 1)`. 
   If the previous value was 0, the call returns 0, indicating that the lock was successfully acquired.
3. Once the lock is acquired, the thread performs a critical operation â€“ in this case, it increments a shared counter. 
   Because the lock guarantees mutual exclusion, the increment can be performed as a normal write; 
   but for safety I use `atomicAdd` so that even if there are mistakes, the code remains correct.
4. After the critical section, the thread releases the lock by writing 0 back to the lock variable.
5. To demonstrate the lock, each thread loops a fixed number of times, acquiring and releasing the lock each time.
6. I chose to launch a modest number of threads (e.g., 256) and a modest number of increments per thread (e.g., 1000) so that the output is quick yet shows that the lock works.
7. I added simple error checking for CUDA API calls.
8. The final value of the counter is printed on the host to verify that all increments were accounted for.
