/*
Demonstrate that the callback function is executed asynchronously from the host thread,
and only after the kernel finishes.

Thinking process:
1. We need a CUDA kernel that takes a noticeable amount of time so we can observe
   the host thread doing something else concurrently. A simple busyâ€‘wait loop will
   suffice. The kernel will run on a separate CUDA stream.
2. CUDA provides `cudaStreamAddCallback` which queues a host function to be called
   after all preceding operations in the stream have finished. The callback runs on
   a different host thread (managed by the CUDA runtime) and is therefore
   asynchronous relative to the thread that added it.
3. To demonstrate this, the main thread will:
   - create a stream,
   - launch the kernel on that stream,
   - register a callback,
   - then immediately perform some host work (printing messages and sleeping).
4. The callback will:
   - print a message,
   - record the current time,
   - set an atomic flag so the main thread knows it has finished.
5. The main thread will wait on that flag after the host work is done, ensuring
   it only continues once the callback has executed.
6. By printing timestamps before and after the kernel launch, during the host
   work, and inside the callback, we can clearly see that:
   * The host continues executing immediately after launching the kernel,
   * The callback is invoked only after the kernel has finished,
   * The callback runs on a separate thread (different thread ID from the main thread).
