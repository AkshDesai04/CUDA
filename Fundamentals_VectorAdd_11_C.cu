**Advantages of a grid‑stride loop**

A grid‑stride loop is a programming pattern used inside CUDA kernels to process data when the amount of work (`N`) may exceed the total number of threads launched. Each thread loops over elements that are “strided” by the total grid size, typically:

```cpp
int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
int stride = gridDim.x * blockDim.x;

for (int i = idx; i < N; i += stride) {
    // process element i
}
```

The key benefits are:

1. **Kernel launch size independence**  
   The kernel no longer needs to be tailored to a specific `N`. Whether `N` is 10, 1 000 000, or anything in between, the same kernel launch parameters (grid size, block size) work correctly. This eliminates the need for special‑case launches or kernel resubmissions when `N` changes.

2. **Simplified launch configuration**  
   You can choose a “reasonable” block size (e.g., 128 or 256 threads) and a small grid size (e.g., 1–4 blocks) without worrying that the launch will leave many elements unprocessed. The loop will automatically cover all elements, even if the grid is smaller than `N`.

3. **Better hardware utilisation for small launches**  
   When `N` is small but you still launch a large grid (common when using generic kernels), many threads may finish early and stay idle. With a grid‑stride loop, even a tiny launch can be “expanded” by each thread to cover more work, ensuring that the GPU’s resources are better utilised. Conversely, if you intentionally launch a small grid for a very large `N`, the loop allows each thread to iterate over many elements, maintaining full occupancy without requiring a massive grid.

4. **Reduced kernel launch overhead**  
   Since the same kernel can be used for a wide range of problem sizes, you avoid launching different kernels for different `N`. This reduces overhead associated with kernel launch configuration and stream synchronization.

5. **Easier code maintenance**  
   The kernel code stays concise and generic; you don’t need multiple versions of the same routine for different sizes. Maintenance and bug‑fixing become simpler.

6. **Graceful handling of edge cases**  
   If `N` is not a multiple of the grid stride, the loop’s termination condition (`i < N`) ensures that the final few elements are processed correctly without requiring special handling.

In summary, a grid‑stride loop makes CUDA kernels *scale automatically*, keeps the launch configuration simple, improves GPU utilisation especially for small grid launches, and reduces both development and runtime complexity.
