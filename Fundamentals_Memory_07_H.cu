`cudaMemcpy` is the primary API call that transfers data between the host (CPU) memory and the device (GPU) memory.  
In CUDA programming there are two distinct memory spaces:

1. **Host memory** – regular RAM that the CPU can read/write directly.  
2. **Device memory** – the VRAM or dedicated memory attached to the GPU that the CUDA kernels execute in.

Because these spaces are physically separate, a pointer that refers to a host buffer is meaningless to the GPU, and vice‑versa. `cudaMemcpy` bridges this gap by performing an explicit, controlled copy operation that moves data from one space to the other (or within the same space).  

Key points of how it bridges the gap:

| Direction | What `cudaMemcpy` does | Typical use case |
|-----------|-----------------------|------------------|
| **Host → Device** | Copies a block of host memory into a previously allocated device buffer. | Copying input data or constants into GPU for kernel use. |
| **Device → Host** | Copies a block of device memory back into a host buffer. | Retrieving results from GPU after kernel execution. |
| **Device → Device** | Copies data between two device buffers (may be useful for intra‑GPU processing). | Rearranging data on the GPU without involving the host. |
| **Host → Host** | Can copy data within host memory but is rarely used in CUDA contexts. | For completeness, but not required for GPU communication. |

### Technical details

1. **Memory region specification**: The API requires you to provide source and destination pointers along with the number of bytes to transfer.  
2. **Memcpy kind**: A `cudaMemcpyKind` enum specifies the direction:  
   ```c
   cudaMemcpyHostToDevice,
   cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost,
   cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice,
   cudaMemcpyHostToHost
   ```  
3. **Synchronization**:  
   - `cudaMemcpy` is a *synchronous* operation with respect to the stream in which it is called.  
   - It blocks the host until the transfer completes (unless you use `cudaMemcpyAsync`, which is asynchronous and can be overlapped with kernel execution).  
4. **Data consistency**: The GPU sees the data only after the copy finishes, ensuring that the device memory contents are up‑to‑date before a kernel launches.

### Example workflow

```c
// Allocate host and device memory
float *h_arr = (float*)malloc(N*sizeof(float));
float *d_arr;
cudaMalloc(&d_arr, N*sizeof(float));

// 1. Copy data from host to device
cudaMemcpy(d_arr, h_arr, N*sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

// 2. Launch kernel that operates on d_arr
myKernel<<<grid, block>>>(d_arr);

// 3. Copy results back from device to host
cudaMemcpy(h_arr, d_arr, N*sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
```

In this sequence, `cudaMemcpy` is the bridge that ensures data moves correctly between the two separate memory spaces, allowing the CPU to provide inputs and receive outputs while the GPU does the heavy computation in its own memory.
