```cpp
/*
Can `cudaMallocHost` (pinned memory allocation) also fail with a memory allocation error? Try it.

Thinking process:
1. We need a program that attempts to allocate pinned host memory using cudaMallocHost
   and intentionally fails to see the error code returned.
2. The program will try to allocate an excessively large buffer that is unlikely to
   fit in system memory, forcing the allocation to fail.
3. We will use cudaGetLastError and cudaError_t to capture and report the failure.
4. Since we want a clear demonstration, we can loop trying to allocate increasingly larger
   blocks until cudaMallocHost returns an error other than cudaSuccess.
5. The program will print out the requested allocation size, the returned error string,
   and whether the allocation succeeded or failed.
6. To keep the example simple and reproducible, we will use a single large allocation
   rather than a loop. The size will be set to a very large value (e.g., 10 TB) which
   will almost certainly fail on any realistic machine.
7. We will also include a check to free the memory if the allocation succeeds
   to avoid leaks.
8. All necessary CUDA headers are included, and we use C++ style output for clarity.
