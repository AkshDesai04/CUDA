/*
Aim: Modify the program to launch the kernel with one block containing two threads.

Thinking:
The task requires a CUDA program in C that demonstrates a kernel launch with exactly one block and two threads. 
A minimal example is a kernel that simply prints its thread index so we can verify the launch configuration. 
To keep the program selfâ€‘contained, we will:
1. Include <stdio.h> for host output.
2. Define a __global__ kernel `printThreadID` that outputs the block and thread indices.
3. In `main`, we will launch this kernel with <<<1, 2>>> which corresponds to 1 block with 2 threads.
4. We will also include a check for kernel launch errors and a synchronization step to ensure the kernel completes before the host exits.
5. Finally, the program will return 0.

This simple structure fulfills the requirement while being easy to compile and run with `nvcc`.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

/* Kernel that prints the thread and block indices */
__global__ void printThreadID(void) {
    int bid = blockIdx.x;
    int tid = threadIdx.x;
    printf("Hello from block %d, thread %d\n", bid, tid);
}

int main(void) {
    /* Launch the kernel with 1 block and 2 threads */
    printThreadID<<<1, 2>>>();
    /* Check for launch errors */
    cudaError_t err = cudaGetLastError();
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Kernel launch failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
        return 1;
    }
    /* Wait for the kernel to finish */
    err = cudaDeviceSynchronize();
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Kernel execution failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
        return 1;
    }
    printf("Kernel execution completed successfully.\n");
    return 0;
