Does this guarantee the printf output will appear before subsequent host code executes? Explain in a comment. (Answer: No, printf is buffered).`\n\n""" \nWe need a small CUDA program that demonstrates a kernel printing via the device printf, then a host call to cudaDeviceSynchronize. We will add a comment after the synchronization explaining that this does NOT guarantee the printf output is flushed before the host proceeds, because device printf is buffered and only flushes when the kernel finishes and the device prints are collected, but the host may continue executing other code before the device output is actually written to stdout. The correct way to force flush would be to call cudaDeviceSynchronize followed by a dummy kernel or explicitly call cudaDeviceFlush (which doesn\'t exist), or rely on the program exit. We\'ll show this in a comment after the synchronization call. The program is fully self-contained, compiles with nvcc, and demonstrates the point. \n"""\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n__global__ void kernel()\n{\n    // Each thread prints a message; device printf is buffered.\n    printf("Hello from thread %d, block %d\\n", threadIdx.x, blockIdx.x);\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    // Launch kernel\n    kernel<<<2, 4>>>();\n    \n    // Synchronize to ensure kernel has finished execution\n    cudaError_t err = cudaDeviceSynchronize();\n    if (err != cudaSuccess) {\n        fprintf(stderr, "cudaDeviceSynchronize failed: %s\\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // Note: Even though cudaDeviceSynchronize waits for the kernel to finish,\n    // the device printf output may still be buffered and not yet flushed to\n    // stdout.
