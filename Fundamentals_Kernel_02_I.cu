/*
Call `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` after the kernel launch. Does this guarantee the `printf` output will appear before subsequent host code executes? Explain in a comment. (Answer: No, `printf` is buffered).

**Thinking process:**
- The requirement is to write a CUDA C program (.cu file) that demonstrates the behavior of device `printf` relative to host code execution.
- We need to launch a kernel that uses `printf` to print from each thread.
- After launching the kernel, we call `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` to wait for all device work to finish.
- The question asks whether this guarantees the device `printf` output will appear before subsequent host code executes.
- According to the CUDA runtime documentation, device `printf` output is buffered and only flushed when the program ends or when explicitly flushed via `cudaDeviceSynchronize()`. However, even after synchronizing, the output may not necessarily appear immediately on the host console before subsequent host code prints; it depends on the buffering of the device and host I/O streams. In practice, the host print may occur before the device print, illustrating that `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` only ensures kernel completion, not the ordering of printed output.
- Therefore, the answer is "No, `printf` is buffered."
- The code will include comments explaining this behavior.
- The kernel will simply print a message from each thread. The host will launch the kernel, synchronize, then print a host message. The comment in the code will elaborate why the device `printf` may appear after the host message.
