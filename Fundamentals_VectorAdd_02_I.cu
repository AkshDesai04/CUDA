/*
Aim: Create a `main` function that accepts `N` as a command-line argument.

Thinking:
- The program will be a simple CUDA host program written in C/C++ (.cu file) that demonstrates how to parse a command-line argument.
- We'll include the standard headers and use the C++ `atoi` function (via `<cstdlib>`) to convert the string argument to an integer.
- If the user does not provide the required argument, the program will print a usage message and exit with an error code.
- We'll also perform a basic sanity check (e.g., ensure `N` is positive) and echo the value back to the user.
- No CUDA kernels are needed for this simple demonstration, but the file is still compiled as a `.cu` file to show the typical CUDA project structure.
- The code is kept minimal yet illustrative of typical command-line argument handling in a CUDA-enabled C++ application.

    // Convert the argument to an integer
    char* endptr;
    long val = std::strtol(argv[1], &endptr, 10);
    if (*endptr != '\0' || val <= 0)
    {
        std::fprintf(stderr, "Error: N must be a positive integer.\n");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    int N = static_cast<int>(val);
    std::printf("Received N = %d\n", N);

    // Placeholder for further CUDA logic using N
    // e.g., allocate device memory of size N, launch kernels, etc.
