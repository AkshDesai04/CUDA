```c
/* 
   Aim: Query and print the memory bus width in bits.
   
   Thinking:
   1. The goal is to write a CUDA program that queries the memory bus width of a GPU device and prints it.
   2. In CUDA Runtime API, the function cudaGetDeviceProperties fills a cudaDeviceProp structure that contains a field called memoryBusWidth which holds the width of the memory bus in bits.
   3. We need to:
      - Include the necessary headers (<stdio.h> for I/O and <cuda_runtime.h> for CUDA runtime functions).
      - Query the number of available CUDA devices to ensure at least one device exists.
      - For simplicity, we will query device 0 (the first GPU). In a more robust program, we could iterate over all devices or allow the user to specify a device index.
      - Call cudaGetDeviceProperties for device 0 and check the return status.
      - If successful, print the memory bus width.
      - Add minimal error handling to report CUDA runtime errors.
   4. The program will compile with nvcc and run on a machine with CUDA installed.
   5. The final code will be a complete .cu file, starting with the multi-line comment that contains the aim and the thinking, followed by the actual CUDA C code.
