/*
Aim: Explain in a comment why there is a limit on the number of threads per block.

In CUDA, each SM (Streaming Multiprocessor) has a finite amount of hardware resources: 
  • Registers per SM
  • Shared memory per SM
  • Warp scheduler slots
  • L1 cache space
  • etc.
A block is mapped onto a single SM. The number of threads in a block determines how many warps are active
within that SM. If a block were allowed to contain arbitrarily many threads, the scheduler would have
to allocate registers, shared memory, and other per-thread resources for all of them. This would quickly
exhaust the SM’s finite resources, making it impossible to launch any block at all or to leave resources
for multiple blocks that can improve occupancy and hide latency. Additionally, CUDA hardware schedules
threads in warps of 32 threads. The maximum block size is thus bounded by the hardware’s ability to
create enough warps to keep the SM busy while respecting per-thread and per-block resource limits.
Therefore, CUDA imposes a maximum number of threads per block (typically 1024 for most GPUs) to
guarantee that each block can be scheduled on an SM without exceeding resource constraints and to
allow multiple blocks to run concurrently for better resource utilization and performance.

Commentary on thinking:
- I identified the relevant hardware resources that impose limits.
- Explained the relationship between threads, warps, and SM resources.
- Mentioned scheduling and occupancy considerations.
- Concluded with the formal limit and its purpose.
- Added the user's exact aim line at the top of the comment block.
