/*
Aim: Explain in a comment why there is a limit on the number of threads per block.

Thought Process:
1. The user explicitly requested an explanation in a comment about the thread-per-block limit.
2. The developer instruction mandates that the entire file must be a .cu source file, and that the first thing in the file is a multiline comment containing the aim of the program exactly as given, plus my full reasoning.
3. Since no specific computational task was requested, I will create a minimal CUDA program that launches a trivial kernel (e.g., printing a message) so the file is a valid CUDA source file.
4. The explanatory comment will also include the reasoning for the limit: hardware resources (registers, shared memory, L2 cache, scheduler capacity), occupancy, and architectural constraints.
5. No other text or output should appear outside the code.
