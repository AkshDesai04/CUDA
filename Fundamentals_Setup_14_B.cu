The asyncEngineCount field indicates the number of copy engines available on the GPU, which determines whether data transfer and kernel execution can be overlapped. \nWe will:\n1. Include the necessary headers: stdio.h and cuda_runtime.h.\n2. Write an error-checking macro to wrap CUDA runtime API calls.\n3. In main, get the number of devices with cudaGetDeviceCount.\n4. Loop over each device, retrieve its properties with cudaGetDeviceProperties.\n5. Print "Device X: has Y copy engines." using the asyncEngineCount field.\n6. If Y > 0, also print "Data copy can be overlapped with kernel execution." on the next line.\nThe program will compile with `nvcc` and run on any system with the CUDA toolkit installed. No GPU kernels are launched; it only queries device properties. \n"""\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n/* Macro for checking CUDA runtime API errors */\n#define CHECK_CUDA(call)                                                         \\\n    do {                                                                         \\\n        cudaError_t err = call;                                                 \\\n        if (err != cudaSuccess) {                                               \\\n            fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error at %s:%d: %s\\n",                        \\\n                    __FILE__, __LINE__, cudaGetErrorString(err));               \\\n            return EXIT_FAILURE;                                                \\\n        }                                                                        \\\n    } while (0)\n\nint main(void) {\n    int deviceCount = 0;\n    CHECK_CUDA(cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount));\n\n    if (deviceCount == 0) {\n        printf("No CUDA-capable devices found.\\n");\n        return EXIT_SUCCESS;\n    }\n\n    for (int dev = 0; dev < deviceCount; ++dev) {\n        cudaDeviceProp prop;\n        CHECK_CUDA(cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, dev));\n\n        printf("Device %d: %s\\n", dev, prop.name);\n        printf("Device has %d copy engine%s.\\n",\n               prop.asyncEngineCount,\n               prop.asyncEngineCount == 1 ?
