/*
Aim of the program:
Change the launch configuration to a non-square 2D block, like 16x4 threads, and print the
2D indices.

Thinking:
To demonstrate a non-square 2D block configuration in CUDA, I chose a block size of 16
threads in the x-dimension and 4 threads in the y-dimension. This creates a rectangular block
with 64 threads per block. The kernel will use printf to output each thread's local
( threadIdx.x, threadIdx.y ) and global ( blockIdx.x, blockIdx.y ) coordinates as well as the
computed linear global indices (globalX, globalY). A small grid of 2x2 blocks is used for
clarity, resulting in a total of 128 threads. After launching the kernel, the host code waits
for completion with cudaDeviceSynchronize() before exiting. The program is selfâ€‘contained
and can be compiled with nvcc as a .cu file.
