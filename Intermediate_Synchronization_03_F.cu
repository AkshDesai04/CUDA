Is there a race condition if multiple threads only *read* from the same location? (No, this is safe and common).

My goal is to write a small CUDA program that demonstrates the fact that concurrent reads from the same memory location are safe
and that there is no race condition.  In CUDA, a race condition can only occur when at least two threads attempt to write
to the same memory location concurrently, or when one thread writes while another reads.  When all threads are only reading
from a location, the memory system guarantees that each thread will see a consistent value, because there is no write
that could create a data hazard.

To illustrate this, I will:

1. Allocate a single integer on the device (`d_src`) and copy a constant value into it from the host.
2. Launch a kernel with many threads.  Each thread will read that single integer (`d_src[0]`) and store the value into its
   own position in a separate output array (`d_dst`).
3. After kernel completion, copy the output array back to the host and verify that every entry matches the expected value.
4. Print a success message if all reads were correct.

If the program runs correctly and prints that all threads read the value properly, it confirms that there is no race
condition when only reading from the same location.  This is the typical use case for broadcasting a constant or
broadcasting read-only data to many threads in CUDA programs.

I will keep the code simple, with minimal error checking, and ensure it compiles with `nvcc`.  The focus is on the
correctness demonstration rather than performance optimization or advanced CUDA features.
