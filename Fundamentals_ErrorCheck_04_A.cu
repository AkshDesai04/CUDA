/*
Aim: Trigger `cudaErrorInvalidValue` by passing a negative size to `cudaMalloc`.

Thinking:
The CUDA runtime API expects the size argument of cudaMalloc to be an unsigned size_t. If we pass a negative integer (by casting), it will become a very large unsigned value, which is not a valid allocation request. According to the CUDA documentation, this situation should cause the runtime to return cudaErrorInvalidValue. The program demonstrates this by attempting such an allocation, checking the returned error code, and printing the corresponding error message. If, for some reason, the allocation succeeds (unlikely), the program frees the memory to avoid leaks. The code is selfâ€‘contained, includes the necessary headers, and compiles as a standard .cu file.

    // Negative size to be passed to cudaMalloc
    int negativeSize = -1024; // any negative value
    size_t size = (size_t)negativeSize; // cast to unsigned type

    void* devPtr = NULL;
    cudaError_t err = cudaMalloc(&devPtr, size);

    if (err != cudaSuccess)
    {
        printf("cudaMalloc failed with error: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
    }
    else
    {
        printf("cudaMalloc succeeded, allocated %zu bytes.\n", size);
        // Free the allocated memory
        cudaFree(devPtr);
    }

    return 0;
