/*
Aim: What happens if you have two bad kernel launches in a row, but only check for an error after the second one? The error from the first launch may be reported.

Thinking:
- The task is to write a small CUDA program that demonstrates how CUDA’s error reporting works when multiple kernel launches fail sequentially but error checking is performed only after the last launch.
- CUDA keeps the most recent error in an internal status variable. If a kernel launch fails (for example, due to an invalid configuration argument), the error code is stored.
- Subsequent kernel launches will override that error code only if they themselves fail. If they also fail, they will set a new error. However, if they succeed (or are no-ops), the original error remains.
- To illustrate the specific scenario, we will intentionally launch two kernels with invalid configurations:
  1. The first launch will use a grid dimension larger than the device’s maximum allowed value, causing an “invalid configuration argument” error.
  2. The second launch will also use an invalid configuration (e.g., zero blocks or too many threads), but we will still check for an error only after this second launch.
- After both launches, we will call `cudaGetLastError()` to retrieve the error. If the second launch succeeded (or was ignored), the error returned will be from the first launch, demonstrating that CUDA reports the most recent failure that hasn't been overwritten by a succeeding operation.
- The code will query device properties to compute a grid size that is guaranteed to exceed the maximum, ensuring reproducible failure.
- The program will print the error string for clarity.
