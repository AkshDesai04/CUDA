If a `__syncthreads()` is omitted at the end of the main tile loop, the block’s threads will not wait for each other to finish using the current tile before beginning to load the next one. This creates a classic **race condition**:

1. **Partial Progress** – Some threads finish the computation on the current tile and immediately start copying the next tile into the shared‑memory buffer, while other threads are still reading from the same buffer to finish their work.

2. **Overwritten Data** – The next tile load can overwrite elements of the shared memory that are still needed by the slower threads. Those threads will then read partially updated or completely wrong values.

3. **Incorrect Results** – The matrix–vector multiplication (or whatever algorithm is being tiled) will use stale or corrupted partial results, producing a wrong final sum for those rows/columns.

4. **Undefined Behavior** – Because the GPU runtime does not detect this misuse, the program will simply execute with corrupted data; it may produce seemingly plausible numbers, completely wrong numbers, or in the worst case, memory errors if the load spills outside the allocated buffer.

5. **Performance Impact** – Even if the result happens to be correct for some inputs, the lack of synchronization may also cause the hardware to perform extra memory transactions and stalls, degrading overall performance.

In short, forgetting the `__syncthreads()` breaks the producer–consumer relationship between the tile loading phase and the computation phase, leading to race conditions that corrupt the algorithm’s correctness and can silently produce incorrect results.
