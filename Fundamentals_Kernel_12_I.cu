/*
Aim: Initialize a `dim3` variable with all three dimensions, e.g., `dim3 grid(4, 2, 2);`.

Thinking:
- The prompt explicitly asks for a CUDA program that demonstrates initializing a dim3 variable with all three dimensions.
- dim3 is a builtâ€‘in CUDA type that stores three unsigned integers used for specifying grid and block dimensions in a kernel launch.
- We must provide a minimal yet complete program so that it compiles with nvcc and shows the usage.
- The code will include:
  * Include the CUDA runtime header to get the definitions.
  * Define a trivial __global__ kernel that does nothing; the focus is on launch syntax.
  * In main(), initialize a dim3 variable called grid with the values (4,2,2).
  * Also define a block dimension for completeness.
  * Launch the kernel using the triple angle bracket syntax.
  * Check for launch errors with cudaGetLastError and synchronize the device.
  * Print a confirmation message using std::cout to demonstrate that the grid dimensions are available on the host.
- The comment block must contain the aim verbatim and an explanation of reasoning and choices, as requested by the developer instructions.
- No other output or text is allowed outside of the code file.
- The final .cu file will start with the multiline comment, followed by the actual code.
