/*
Aim of the program: Query and print the PCI domain ID for the device.
All the following logic is intended to be inside this comment block as requested.

The main goal is to obtain the PCI domain ID for the first CUDA-capable GPU
present in the system. The CUDA Runtime API provides a structure called
cudaDeviceProp, which contains a member called pciDomainID that stores this
information (available from CUDA 9 onward). The steps are:

1. Determine the number of CUDA devices using cudaGetDeviceCount.
2. For each device (in this example, just the first one), retrieve its
   cudaDeviceProp structure with cudaGetDeviceProperties.
3. Extract the pciDomainID field from the structure.
4. Print the PCI domain ID to stdout.
5. Include error checking macros for concise error handling.

Edge cases handled:
- If no CUDA devices are found, the program will print a message and exit.
- If the cudaGetDeviceProperties call fails (which could happen on older
  CUDA versions that don't expose pciDomainID), the program will print an
  error.

The code below is a complete, compilable CUDA C program. Compile it with
`nvcc -o pci_domain pci_domain.cu` and run `./pci_domain` to see the
result. No external files or libraries are needed beyond the CUDA toolkit.
