/*
Aim of the program: Explain in a comment why memory leaks are bad, especially on a shared resource like a GPU.

Thinking:
- Memory leaks on the GPU mean that allocated device memory is not freed after use.
- GPUs share a fixed amount of VRAM among all running processes. A leak consumes this finite pool.
- As processes accumulate leaked memory, fewer resources remain for new allocations, leading to allocation failures or reduced performance.
- The GPU scheduler may need to evict or page out other data, causing stalls.
- In multi-tenant or cloud GPU environments, leaks from one user can degrade the experience of all users sharing the same GPU.
- Repeated leaks can exhaust the memory, forcing the driver to reclaim or restart the GPU, disrupting applications.
- Therefore, properly freeing GPU memory is essential for stability, performance, and fair resource sharing.
