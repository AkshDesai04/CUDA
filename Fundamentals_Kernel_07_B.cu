/*
Inside the kernel, calculate a flattened 1D thread index from the 2D indices: `int id_1d = threadIdx.y * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;`. Print this value.

I will write a minimal CUDA program that launches a small 2D block of threads, each thread calculates its flattened 1D index using the provided formula, and prints that index using the device `printf`. The kernel will be launched with a single block of size 2Ã—2 for simplicity. The host code will include basic error checking, launch the kernel, synchronize, and exit. The program will be fully self-contained in a single .cu file, ready to compile with `nvcc`. The goal is to demonstrate the calculation of a 1D thread index from 2D thread indices and to output that value from each thread.
