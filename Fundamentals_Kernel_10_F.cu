Pass it by value, and have the kernel try to dereference the pointer. Explain the result.`\n\n""" \nWe need to illustrate that when a struct containing a pointer member is passed by value to a CUDA kernel, the pointer value is simply copied. If that pointer points to host memory, the device will interpret it as a device address and any dereference will lead to an illegal memory access (typically a segmentation fault or a cudaErrorInvalidDevicePointer). \n\nThe CUDA program will:\n1. Define a struct `MyStruct` with a pointer and an int field.\n2. Allocate host data and create a struct instance whose pointer points to host memory.\n3. Launch a kernel that receives this struct by value and attempts to dereference the pointer. After synchronization we will check for CUDA errors, which should indicate an illegal memory access.\n4. For contrast, allocate device memory, set the struct\'s pointer to that device address, and launch another kernel. This should succeed and print the value.\n5. The program includes error checking macros and uses `cudaPrintf` (standard `printf` inside kernels) to display results.\n\nThis demonstrates that passing a struct with a host pointer by value to a kernel causes undefined behavior because the pointer value is not automatically relocated to device memory. The safe approach is to ensure that any pointer in a struct passed to a kernel points to device memory, or to avoid passing pointers in structs altogether.
