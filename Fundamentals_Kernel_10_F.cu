```c
/*
Aim of the program (exactly as requested):
"What happens if the struct contains a pointer member (e.g., int* p)? Pass it by value, and have the kernel try to dereference the pointer. Explain the result."

Thinking and explanation:
- In CUDA, kernel arguments are passed by value. If the argument is a struct that contains a pointer, the pointer value (an address) is copied to the device.
- If that pointer points to device memory (a valid GPU address), the kernel can safely dereference it. This is because the pointer is in the same address space as the kernel.
- However, if the pointer refers to host memory (i.e., a CPU address), the kernel will receive an address that is meaningless in the GPU address space. Dereferencing such a pointer results in undefined behavior, often leading to a segmentation fault or an invalid memory access error when the kernel runs.
- The program below demonstrates both cases:
  1. A struct whose pointer points to device memory – the kernel prints the value correctly.
  2. A struct whose pointer points to host memory – the kernel attempts to dereference it, causing an invalid launch (typically reported as a segmentation fault or similar).
- The code uses CUDA's `printf` in the kernel to print results. It also checks the kernel launch status to report any errors.
