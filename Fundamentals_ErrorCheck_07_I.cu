/*
Why does CUDA use an asynchronous model? (Performance, allows CPU and GPU to work in parallel).

Thoughts on the program:
- The aim is to illustrate CUDA's asynchronous execution model in a very simple way.
- By launching a kernel and then immediately performing another CPU operation (e.g., printing a message),
  we can observe that the CPU does not wait for the GPU kernel to finish before continuing.
- The kernel itself does a trivial vector addition to keep the example short and selfâ€‘contained.
- After the kernel launch, we use cudaDeviceSynchronize() to ensure all GPU work is finished before we read back
  the result and exit, making the program correct while still demonstrating asynchrony.
- The code uses only standard CUDA C/C++ constructs, making it easy to compile with nvcc.
- Comments are added to explain each step, particularly where asynchrony is relevant.
