```c
/* 
 * Aim: Write a program to check and print the L2 cache size of the primary GPU in kilobytes (KB).
 *
 * My thinking:
 * 1. Use the CUDA Runtime API to query the device properties. The relevant field in 
 *    `cudaDeviceProp` is `l2CacheSize`, which holds the L2 cache size in bytes.
 * 2. The "primary GPU" in CUDA parlance refers to the current device selected by the 
 *    runtime. We can obtain its device ID using `cudaGetDevice()`. If that call fails, 
 *    we fall back to device 0 as a reasonable default.
 * 3. After retrieving the properties, we convert the L2 cache size from bytes to kilobytes
 *    by dividing by 1024. This is a simple integer conversion, but we keep it in a
 *    `size_t` to avoid any sign/overflow issues on 64â€‘bit systems.
 * 4. Print the result using `printf`. If the `l2CacheSize` field reports 0, we print a
 *    message indicating that the cache size is unknown or not reported by the device.
 * 5. Add basic error handling: check the return value of each CUDA API call and exit
 *    with an error message if something goes wrong.
 *
 * The program is written as a single .cu file and can be compiled with `nvcc`:
 *    nvcc -o l2_cache_size l2_cache_size.cu
 * Running it will output something like:
 *    L2 cache size of device 0: 8192 KB
