```cpp
/* 
Extend the previous program to iterate through all available CUDA devices. For each device, use `cudaGetDeviceProperties` to retrieve its properties and print its name (e.g., 'NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080') and its compute capability (e.g., 'Compute Capability: 8.6'). 

My thinking process for this task is as follows:

1. The user wants a program that enumerates all CUDA devices present on the system. 
2. The CUDA Runtime API provides `cudaGetDeviceCount` to obtain the number of devices, and `cudaGetDeviceProperties` to get detailed information about a specific device.
3. We need to include the necessary headers: `<cstdio>` for printing and `<cuda_runtime.h>` for CUDA runtime functions.
4. For error handling, I'll create a helper macro `CUDA_CHECK` that checks the return value of a CUDA call and prints an error message if it fails.
5. The program will:
   - Call `cudaGetDeviceCount` to determine how many devices are available.
   - If the count is zero, print a message and exit.
   - Otherwise, loop over each device index:
     * Optionally set the current device with `cudaSetDevice` (not strictly required for property queries, but keeps the logic clear).
     * Retrieve the properties with `cudaGetDeviceProperties`.
     * Print the device name and compute capability (major.minor).
6. After printing all device information, the program will exit successfully.
7. Since the requirement is to produce a `.cu` file, I'll write the code in a single file, with the multiâ€‘line comment at the top containing the exact prompt text and my reasoning.
8. No other supporting files or text will be output, only the `.cu` content.

Now I'll present the complete CUDA source file below.
