```cuda
/* 
Aim of the program: Launch the kernel with a 2D block of (8, 8) threads and have each thread print only its threadIdx.x.

Thinking:
1. The requirement is to use a 2‑D block of size 8×8. We can launch a single block of this size since the task is trivial.
2. Each thread needs to print its own threadIdx.x value. In CUDA, device-side printf is available, so we simply call printf inside the kernel.
3. The kernel signature will be __global__ void printThreadIdxX().
4. In the kernel body, we use printf("threadIdx.x = %d\n", threadIdx.x); to output the value.
5. In main, we launch the kernel with <<<1, dim3(8,8)>>>, wait for completion with cudaDeviceSynchronize(), and check for errors.
6. The program is self‑contained: includes <stdio.h> for printf and <cuda_runtime.h> for CUDA API calls.
7. No extra command line arguments or configuration are needed.
8. The output will contain 64 lines (8 rows × 8 columns), each showing the x‑coordinate of the thread that executed it.
