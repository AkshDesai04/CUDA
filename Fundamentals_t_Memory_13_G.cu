/* 
Aim of the program: What happens if you pass a negative size to `cudaMalloc`?

Thinking:
- `cudaMalloc` expects a `size_t` argument for the number of bytes to allocate.
- In C, a negative integer literal (e.g., -1) is of type `int`. When it is
  implicitly converted to `size_t` (an unsigned type), the value wraps around
  to a very large number (`SIZE_MAX` for -1, or `SIZE_MAX - 99` for -100, etc.).
- The CUDA runtime will attempt to allocate that many bytes. On almost all
  systems this request is far larger than the device memory, so the call will
  fail with an error such as `cudaErrorMemoryAllocation` or
  `cudaErrorInvalidValue`.
- The program below demonstrates this by trying to allocate a negative
  amount of memory, printing the resulting error string, and exiting.
- This illustrates that passing a negative size does not result in a
  negative allocation (which is impossible); instead it is interpreted as a
  huge unsigned value leading to an allocation failure.
