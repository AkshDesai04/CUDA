```cpp
/*
Demonstrate catching an asynchronous error from inside the kernel (e.g. an illegal memory access) using `CHECK(cudaDeviceSynchronize())`.

Thought process:
1. I need a CUDA program that intentionally triggers an illegal memory access inside a kernel.
2. The error must be caught asynchronously by calling `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` after the kernel launch.
3. To clearly show the error handling, I will create a simple kernel that writes to a device array using an index that can go out of bounds.
4. I will allocate a small array on the device (e.g., 32 elements) but launch more threads (e.g., 64). Threads with indices 32–63 will write out of bounds, causing an illegal memory access.
5. I will wrap CUDA API calls in a `CHECK` macro that prints a descriptive error message and exits if the call fails.
6. After launching the kernel, I will call `CHECK(cudaDeviceSynchronize())`. This call should return an error code indicating the illegal memory access that occurred during the kernel execution.
7. For completeness, I will also query `cudaGetLastError()` before synchronization to show that the error is pending and only revealed when synchronizing.
8. The program will be a single .cu file, fully self‑contained and ready to compile with `nvcc`.
