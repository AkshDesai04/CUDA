/*********************************************************************
 * Aim of the program: "Could shared memory be used to fix this problem? 
 * Describe a strategy where a block would perform a strided read into 
 * shared memory, sync, and then a coalesced write from shared memory to 
 * the output (or vice versa)."
 * 
 * Thinking:
 * 1. The problem is that a naive memory access pattern in a CUDA kernel 
 *    can lead to uncoalesced memory transactions, especially when each 
 *    thread accesses elements that are far apart in global memory.  
 * 2. Shared memory can be used as a staging buffer to transform a 
 *    strided (non-coalesced) read pattern into a coalesced write pattern.  
 * 3. The strategy:
 *    - Each thread in a block reads an element from the input array that
 *      is spaced out by the block size (a strided access).  This is the
 *      uncoalesced part but it is performed once per block per thread.
 *    - The read elements are stored into shared memory.  Since the data
 *      now resides in a contiguous region of shared memory, a subsequent
 *      write from shared memory can be done with a coalesced pattern.
 *    - Synchronize the block to ensure all loads are complete before 
 *      writes.  Then each thread writes back its element from shared 
 *      memory to the output array in a contiguous manner.
 * 4. The kernel below demonstrates this pattern.  It copies an array 
 *    from `d_in` to `d_out` using the described strategy.  For 
 *    simplicity we assume the array size is a multiple of the block 
 *    size times the number of blocks.
