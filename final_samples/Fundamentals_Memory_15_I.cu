```cpp
/*
Aim of the program (exactly as given in the prompt):
"What happens to the value of a __device__ variable when the application exits?"

Thinking:
The purpose of this small CUDA program is to illustrate that a __device__ variable lives only
as long as the application is running. When the process terminates, the GPU memory that holds
device symbols is freed by the driver. There is no persistence of the variableâ€™s value across
runs unless you explicitly copy it back to the host or write it to a file. This code declares
a __device__ integer, modifies it from a kernel, copies the value back to the host, prints it,
and then exits. When the program finishes, the GPU memory containing the device variable is
released, so the value is lost. The output will show the value while the program is running,
but after exit the GPU state is cleared.
