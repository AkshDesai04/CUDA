/*
Aim of the program (exactly as requested in the prompt):
Launch the hanging kernel. Does the main function ever exit? Why or why not?

Thinking:
We create a simple CUDA kernel that contains an infinite loop, effectively
“hanging” forever. In the host `main` we launch this kernel and then
call `cudaDeviceSynchronize()`. `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` blocks the host
thread until the device has finished all preceding kernels. Since our
kernel never exits, the call never returns. Consequently, the `main`
function will never exit; it is stuck waiting for the kernel to finish.
If we omitted the synchronize call, `main` would exit immediately
after launching the kernel, and the process would terminate, killing the
kernel. Therefore, the presence of `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` is what
prevents `main` from ever exiting in this scenario.

Full program follows.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// Infinite-loop kernel: simulates a hanging kernel
__global__ void hangingKernel()
{
    // Each thread spins forever
    while (true) {
        // Optional: do nothing or perform trivial operations
    }
}

int main()
{
    // Launch the kernel with 1 block of 1 thread (sufficient for demonstration)
    hangingKernel<<<1, 1>>>();

    // Synchronize to wait for the kernel to finish (it never will)
    // This will block forever, so main never exits.
    cudaError_t err = cudaDeviceSynchronize();

    // This code will never be reached
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        printf("CUDA error: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
    } else {
        printf("Kernel finished (this will never print)\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
