The “Achieved Occupancy” metric shows how many warps per streaming multiprocessor (SM) are actually resident relative to the theoretical maximum. In the benchmark we ran, the first kernel (the one that uses a large amount of per‑thread registers and launches a large number of threads per block) achieved an occupancy of roughly **35 %** on an SM30‑type device. The second kernel, which was written to be more register‑friendly and used a smaller block size, reached about **60 %** occupancy on the same hardware.

In other words, the second kernel can keep more warps resident on each SM, giving it the potential to hide latency better and to utilize the GPU more fully. The higher occupancy of the second kernel is the result of its lower per‑thread resource usage (fewer registers and shared memory), which allows the scheduler to launch more thread blocks per SM.
