```cuda
/*
 * Launch an 8x8 block. Have only the threads on the first row (`threadIdx.y == 0`) print their `threadIdx.x`.
 *
 * Thinking:
 * 1. The requirement is to launch a single block with dimensions 8x8.
 * 2. Inside the kernel, only threads where threadIdx.y == 0 should execute a printf.
 * 3. Since we want the output to come from the device, we use the CUDA device printf facility.
 * 4. We'll configure the grid with a single block (1,1,1) and the block with dimensions (8,8,1).
 * 5. The kernel will check the condition and print threadIdx.x accordingly.
 * 6. After launching, we need to synchronize and reset the device to clean up.
 * 7. Include error checking for kernel launch and synchronization to ensure correctness.
 * 8. The program is minimal but self-contained: it can be compiled with nvcc and run to see the output.
