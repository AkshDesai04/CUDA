 * Aim of the program:
 * 
 * Generalize this to require more than two passes if the number of partial sums is still too large for a single block.
 * 
 * Thinking:
 * 1. The goal is to perform a parallel reduction (sum) on an arbitrarily large input array using CUDA. 
 *    A single-pass reduction works when the number of partial sums that a block must compute is less than or equal to the number of threads in that block. However, for very large arrays, even after the first pass the number of partial sums can still exceed the capacity of a single block.
 * 2. To handle this, we implement a hierarchical, multi-pass reduction. Each pass reduces the data size by roughly the block size. We keep launching reduction kernels until the resulting number of partial sums fits within a single block.
 * 3. We use a generic reduction kernel that sums elements of the input array and writes the partial sums to an output array. This kernel is parameterized by the stride and the block size. The kernel performs a classic tree-based reduction inside shared memory.
 * 4. On the host side, we allocate device buffers for the input and an intermediate buffer for partial sums. We then iterate: compute the grid and block dimensions based on the current data size, launch the reduction kernel, synchronize, and then swap the input and output buffers for the next pass. The loop terminates when the size of the data to reduce is <= blockDim, at which point we perform the final reduction in a single block and copy the result back to the host.
 * 5. Edge cases: 
 *    - If the array size is 0 or 1, handle trivially.
 *    - Ensure that we use `cudaMalloc`, `cudaMemcpy`, and error checking after each CUDA API call.
 *    - For simplicity, we use float data type and a fixed maximum block size (e.g., 1024). This can be adapted for other data types or variable block sizes.
 * 6. Performance: The hierarchical approach is simple and works for any array size, but it may launch multiple kernels. For very large arrays, this is still efficient because each kernel reduces the problem size by a factor of the block size. In practice, you might want to fuse kernels or use more advanced techniques (e.g., using CUDA cooperative groups or dynamic parallelism), but this implementation keeps the logic straightforward and demonstrates the multi-pass concept.
