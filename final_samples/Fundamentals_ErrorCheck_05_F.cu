If your system reports that it has **no CUDA-capable GPUs** (i.e., `cudaGetDeviceCount()` returns `0`), then any attempt to set a device number that does not exist will be rejected by the runtime.

```cpp
cudaError_t err = cudaSetDevice(0);
```

Because the device index `0` is out of range, the CUDA Runtime will return the error code **`cudaErrorInvalidDevice`** (or `cudaErrorNoDevice` in very old versions). The call does **not** create a context, so no GPU resources are allocated. Subsequent CUDA API calls that implicitly depend on a valid device context will also fail (usually with `cudaErrorInvalidDevice` or `cudaErrorNoDevice`).

In practice:

1. `cudaSetDevice(0)` returns an error.
2. The program should check the return value and handle the error (e.g., exit or fall back to CPU).
3. If you ignore the error, kernel launches or memory copies will silently fail or produce undefined behavior.

So, with zero devices, `cudaSetDevice(0)` will fail and the program must handle that failure.
