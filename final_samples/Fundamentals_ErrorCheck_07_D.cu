```cpp
/*
How are asynchronous errors reported? (Via a subsequent synchronous call or `cuda...Synchronize`).

This program demonstrates that errors occurring in CUDA kernels are reported
asynchronously.  When a kernel launch fails due to resource constraints or
invalid configuration, the runtime does not return an error code immediately.
Instead, the error is queued and will be returned by the next synchronous API
call that performs a device-to-host synchronization, such as `cudaDeviceSynchronize()`
or by a subsequent synchronous CUDA runtime function.

The program follows these steps:
1. Allocate a small device array.
2. Launch a simple kernel with an intentionally excessive grid size
   (far beyond what the GPU can handle), which will cause a launch failure.
3. Immediately query the error status using `cudaGetLastError()`.  
   This call is synchronous but typically does not catch the asynchronous
   launch error; it usually returns `cudaSuccess`.
4. Call `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` to force a synchronization with the device.
   This is where the previously queued error is reported.
5. Perform a synchronous `cudaMemcpy()` after the failed launch to illustrate
   that subsequent calls are also affected by the earlier error state.
6. Clean up and exit.

The output will show that the error is only detected after the explicit
synchronization step, confirming that asynchronous errors are reported
via subsequent synchronous calls or `cuda...Synchronize`.
