```cpp
/*
The aim of the program is to launch a CUDA kernel with a grid dimension of 0 and
observe the error that occurs as a result. According to CUDA's runtime API
documentation, launching a kernel with any dimension (block or grid) set to
zero is invalid and should trigger the error code cudaErrorInvalidConfiguration
(3). This program deliberately sets the grid dimension to zero to demonstrate
that the CUDA runtime reports this specific error. The program prints the
error message returned by cudaGetLastError() so that the user can verify the
exact error that occurs.

Thinking:
1. Define a minimal kernel that does nothing â€“ just to have something to launch.
2. In the main function, launch the kernel using a dim3 for grid with x=0
   (dim3(0, 1, 1)) and a valid block dimension (dim3(256, 1, 1)).
3. Immediately after the kernel launch, call cudaGetLastError() to capture the
   runtime error.
4. Print the error string using cudaGetErrorString().
5. Exit. This will produce the expected error output indicating an invalid
   configuration due to a zero grid dimension.
