```cuda
/* 
Aim of the program (word to word as passed in the prompt): 
Create a second empty kernel with a different name and launch both kernels from the host.

Thinking:
- The task is to demonstrate launching two separate kernels that are effectively no-ops.
- To keep it minimal, each kernel will have no body or just a simple comment inside.
- We will use standard CUDA host code to launch each kernel with a simple 1x1x1 grid/block.
- After launching, we will call cudaDeviceSynchronize to ensure both kernels have completed before the program exits.
- For completeness, we include basic error checking on kernel launches and the final synchronization.
- The code is written in CUDA C and compiled as a .cu file.
