/*
Explain why spin-locks are generally a bad idea on GPUs. (Massive thread counts cause extreme contention; threads that are spinning are wasting execution resources and preventing other warps from running).

// My thinking while writing this program:
// The user explicitly asked for a CUDA program (.cu file) that explains why spin-locks are a bad idea on GPUs. The developer instruction requires that I place the exact aim of the program inside a multiline comment at the very beginning, followed by my entire thought process. After that, I must output only the code for the .cu file, with no other text. 
// The simplest way to "explain" in a program is to have the program print the explanation to the console. I choose to use a small CUDA kernel that prints the explanation from a few GPU threads. This demonstrates the use of device printf (supported on compute capability 2.0+), but it doesn't actually involve spin-locks or contention – it merely outputs the explanation. If one wanted a more elaborate demo, one could implement a dummy spin-lock and show contention, but that would be more involved. The user’s request is for an explanation, so a simple print suffices.
// I will include the necessary includes, a device kernel that prints the statement, a simple host launch, and synchronization. This will produce a minimal, self‑contained .cu file that fulfills the prompt.

    // Each thread prints the explanation once.
    // This is just a demonstration; no actual spin-lock is used.

           "threads that are spinning waste execution resources and prevent other warps from running.\n");
