/*
Can you write to a __constant__ variable from within a kernel? Try it and observe the compiler error.
The goal of this program is to demonstrate that __constant__ memory on the device is readâ€‘only from kernels. 
We declare a constant variable, attempt to modify it inside a __global__ function, and then launch that kernel. 
During compilation, NVCC will generate an error because assignments to __constant__ variables are not allowed inside kernels
(since constant memory is intended to be read only by device code). The error message typically looks like: 
"assignment to read-only variable". This code is intentionally incorrect to trigger that error.

// Kernel attempting to write to the constant variable

    // This line should cause a compilation error
    const_val = 42;
}

{
    // Launch the kernel
    write_to_const<<<1, 1>>>();
