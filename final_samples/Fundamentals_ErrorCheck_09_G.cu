/*
Can you throw an exception from `__device__` code? (No). Explain why.
  
Thought Process:
  
- CUDA device code runs on GPU cores that have a very different execution model than CPU cores.
- Exception handling in C++ relies on runtime support for stack unwinding, exception tables, and
  exception objects.  
- The CUDA compiler (nvcc) does not generate the necessary exception tables for device code,
  and the GPU hardware does not support the required stack unwinding mechanisms.
- Consequently, attempting to `throw` or `catch` from a `__device__` function is a compile‑time
  error: `nvcc: error: 'throw' not allowed in __device__ function`.
- The proper way to signal errors from device code is to return error codes, use CUDA error
  API functions (e.g., `cudaGetLastError()`), or set device‑side flags that the host can query.
  This avoids the need for C++ exception handling on the GPU.
