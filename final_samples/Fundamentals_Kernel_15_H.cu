```cuda
/*
Write a kernel with an infinite loop where only thread 0 loops forever. The other threads finish. Does the block as a whole ever finish? (No, requires all threads to finish).

Thoughts:
1. The requirement is to create a CUDA kernel where thread 0 executes an infinite loop while all other threads finish normally.
2. In CUDA, threads are grouped into warps and blocks execute in lock‑step. If any thread in a warp remains active (e.g., stuck in an infinite loop), the entire warp cannot finish, and consequently the block never terminates.
3. The answer to the question is that the block never finishes because every thread in the block must complete execution for the block to terminate.
4. To demonstrate this behavior, we will launch a kernel with a single block and many threads. Thread 0 will run an infinite loop. Other threads will print a message and exit.
5. To prevent the compiler from optimizing the infinite loop away (since it has no observable side effects), we introduce a global volatile integer that thread 0 increments in the loop.
6. The host code will launch the kernel and immediately check for errors. Since thread 0 never exits, the host will hang after the kernel launch, illustrating that the block does not finish.
7. The code is kept simple and self‑contained. It uses `printf` for demonstration, which requires the GPU architecture to support it (e.g., compute capability ≥ 2.0). No additional memory allocations are needed.
8. The program is written in C/CUDA style and can be compiled with `nvcc` to produce an executable.
