```cuda
/*
Aim of the program: Modify the kernel so each thread prints `gridDim.x - 1 - blockIdx.x` (its block index from the end of the grid).

Thinking:
- The goal is to demonstrate how to access block indices from the end of the grid inside a CUDA kernel.
- We need to compute `gridDim.x - 1 - blockIdx.x` for each thread and print it using `printf` inside the kernel.
- To keep the output manageable, we use one thread per block. This way, each block will print a single line indicating its "reverse" index.
- The kernel does not need any arguments, so it can be declared with no parameters.
- In the host code, we launch the kernel with a specified number of blocks and one thread per block.
- After kernel launch, we synchronize the device to ensure all prints complete before the program exits.
- Compilation is done with `nvcc` (e.g., `nvcc -o reverse_block_index reverse_block_index.cu`).
