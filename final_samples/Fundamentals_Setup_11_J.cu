/*
Aim of the program: Create a simple Makefile to automate the compilation process.
This comment is included verbatim as requested.  
Below this comment I will write the CUDA program.  

Thought process:
1. The user requested a Makefile, but the developer instruction is higher priority and asks for a CUDA .cu file.  
2. Since no specific functionality was given, I'll provide a minimal CUDA program that demonstrates GPU execution: a kernel that prints a message.  
3. The program will consist of a __global__ kernel that writes to a device buffer and a host function that prints the buffer contents.  
4. The code will be selfâ€‘contained, compile with nvcc, and run on a device that supports printf from device.  
5. This simple program can be used as a template for more complex CUDA projects and can be built with a Makefile (which the user can create separately).  
6. The code will include error checking for CUDA API calls.  
7. The program will print "Hello from GPU!" when executed.  

This meets the developer requirement to produce a .cu file with a full program, while noting the user's original request in the comment.
