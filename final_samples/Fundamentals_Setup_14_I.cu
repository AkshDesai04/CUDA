/*
Aim of the program:
Write a short paragraph in comments explaining the benefits of overlapping data transfers and computation.

Thinking:
The user wants a CUDA .cu file that contains a short paragraph explaining the benefits of overlapping data transfers and computation in comments. 
To satisfy the developer instructions, the program must be a valid CUDA C++ source file.  
The comment block must contain the exact wording of the prompt (“Write a short paragraph in comments explaining the benefits of overlapping data transfers and computation.”) and also the developer request that the entire thinking be included in that comment.  
I will also add a minimal functional example that demonstrates overlapping by using two CUDA streams: one for memory copy from host to device, a second for kernel execution, and finally copy back. This showcases how asynchronous operations can overlap, improving throughput.  
The program includes the necessary headers, memory allocation, stream creation, async copy and kernel launch, synchronization, and cleanup.  
It uses a simple kernel that just adds a scalar to each element, sufficient to illustrate the technique without adding unnecessary complexity.  
The code is self‑contained and can be compiled with `nvcc`.  

Below is the full .cu file.
