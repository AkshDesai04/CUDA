**Analysis of `cuda-memcheck --tool synccheck` output**

The **synccheck** tool in CUDA‑Memcheck is designed to detect **synchronization errors** in device code.  
When you run a kernel with

```bash
cuda-memcheck --tool synccheck ./your_executable
```

it instruments the kernel for the following conditions:

1. **Missing `__syncthreads()`** – If a thread in a warp reaches a barrier (`__syncthreads()`) and other threads do not, the kernel stalls.  
2. **Mismatched `__syncthreads()`** – Threads that call the barrier do not all call it the same number of times in a given execution path.  
3. **Race conditions on shared memory** – Two threads write to the same shared memory location without proper synchronization.  
4. **Out‑of‑bounds shared memory accesses** – Reading/writing beyond the declared shared‑memory array size.  

Below is a typical **synccheck** report you might see when the kernel contains a classic error such as a missing `__syncthreads()` before a shared‑memory read that follows a write by another thread:

```
$ cuda-memcheck --tool synccheck ./my_kernel
========= CUDA-MEMCHECK
[ERROR] [CUDA-ERROR] (0000000000) Kernel sync error detected at line 45 of file: my_kernel.cu
   The thread group that executed this kernel had a thread that called __syncthreads()
   while another thread did not.  This may have caused a deadlock.

[ERROR] [CUDA-ERROR] (0000000001) Inconsistent __syncthreads() usage at line 53 of file: my_kernel.cu
   Thread block 0, thread 12 performed an unexpected __syncthreads() call.
   The last __syncthreads() call in this block was at line 45.  This mismatch
   indicates that threads are following different execution paths and
   thus are not synchronized.

[ERROR] [CUDA-ERROR] (0000000002) Shared memory out of bounds access at line 60 of file: my_kernel.cu
   Thread block 0, thread 2 accessed shared memory at offset 512, which is
   beyond the allocated shared memory size of 512 bytes.

========= END
```

### How to interpret the output

| Error code | Meaning | Typical fix |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| `0000000000` | **Missing `__syncthreads()`** – a thread reached a barrier that others did not. | Add `__syncthreads()` before the missing point or restructure the code so all threads in the block hit the barrier. |
| `0000000001` | **Inconsistent barrier usage** – some threads call `__syncthreads()` an extra time or fewer times. | Ensure all code paths hit the same number of `__syncthreads()` calls, or guard the barrier with a `if` that is true for all threads. |
| `0000000002` | **Shared memory out‑of‑bounds** – read/write beyond the declared shared array. | Increase the shared‑memory size or correct the index calculation. |
| `0000000003` | **Shared memory race** – unsynchronized concurrent writes to the same shared location. | Use atomic operations or introduce proper synchronization (`__syncthreads()`) between the conflicting writes. |

### Quick checklist for debugging

1. **Check every `__syncthreads()`**  
   - Is it called in all code paths?  
   - Are there any early `return`, `if` statements that skip the barrier?  

2. **Verify shared‑memory bounds**  
   - Compute the maximum index used (including loop bounds) and compare it to the size declared in the kernel launch.  

3. **Avoid conditional barriers**  
   - If a barrier must be conditional, guard the entire block of code so that all threads that might reach it are guaranteed to execute it.

4. **Use `__syncthreads()` after any shared‑memory write that other threads will read**  
   - This ensures the write is visible before subsequent reads.

5. **Re‑run `synccheck` after each fix**  
   - The tool will report the first remaining error; address it and iterate.

**Bottom line:**  
`cuda-memcheck --tool synccheck` is a very helpful sanity‑check for synchronization logic in CUDA kernels. It reports precise line numbers and thread IDs that caused the violation, allowing you to pinpoint and fix subtle bugs that could otherwise lead to deadlocks, data races, or incorrect results.
