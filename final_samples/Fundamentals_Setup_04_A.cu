```c
/*
Aim of the program (word to word):
After printing the warp size, add a comment explaining what a warp is and why its size is important for performance (e.g., memory coalescing, SIMT execution).

Thinking:
The user wants a CUDA .cu file that prints the warp size and then includes an explanatory comment. The warp size is a device property (cudaDeviceProp.warpSize). We'll query the device properties on the host and print the value. After that, a comment block will explain what a warp is and why its size matters for performance, touching on memory coalescing and SIMT execution. No additional output or supporting files are needed. The code will be selfâ€‘contained, compile with nvcc, and include standard headers. We'll also add a simple check for cuda errors. The program will print the warp size to stdout and then terminate.

The file content below is the complete .cu file with the required comment at the top, the program, and the explanatory comment after the warp size output. No other text is produced.

    /*
    A warp is a group of threads that execute the same instruction at the same time on a GPU.
    On NVIDIA GPUs, a warp typically contains 32 threads, though the size can vary on newer architectures.
    The warp size is important for performance because:

    1. Memory coalescing: Threads within a warp access memory addresses that are contiguous or in a pattern
       that allows the GPU to combine multiple memory requests into a single transaction. If threads access
       scattered addresses, memory bandwidth is wasted and performance drops.

    2. SIMT execution: The Single Instruction, Multiple Threads (SIMT) model schedules a warp as a unit.
       If all threads in a warp follow the same execution path (no divergence), they can complete the instruction
       in one cycle. Divergence (e.g., due to branch conditions) causes serialization of the different paths,
       reducing throughput.

    Because of these factors, designing kernels to keep threads in a warp accessing contiguous memory
    and minimizing warp divergence is key to achieving high performance on CUDA GPUs.
