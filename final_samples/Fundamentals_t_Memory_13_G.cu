/*
What happens if you pass a negative size to `cudaMalloc`?

Thinking:
In CUDA, cudaMalloc expects a size_t argument, which is an unsigned integer type. If we pass a negative integer literal like -1, it will be implicitly converted to size_t, resulting in the maximum unsigned value (wrap-around). This huge allocation request is obviously infeasible and should cause cudaMalloc to fail. According to the CUDA Runtime API documentation, passing a negative value (after conversion) should result in an error code, typically cudaErrorMemoryAllocation or cudaErrorInvalidValue. The program below demonstrates this by attempting to allocate a memory block with a size of -1 cast to size_t, then checking the returned error code and printing the corresponding CUDA error string. It also shows that attempting to allocate a "negative" size leads to a failure rather than an allocation of a negative amount of memory, which is logically impossible. This example serves as a practical illustration of how CUDA handles such erroneous inputs.

int main(void) {
    // Attempt to allocate a negative size (-1) which will be converted to a large unsigned value.
    size_t badSize = (size_t)-1;  // This is 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF on 64-bit systems
    int *d_ptr = NULL;

    cudaError_t err = cudaMalloc((void**)&d_ptr, badSize);

    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        printf("cudaMalloc failed with error code %d: %s\n", err, cudaGetErrorString(err));
    } else {
        printf("cudaMalloc unexpectedly succeeded (should not happen).\n");
        // Clean up if somehow succeeded
        cudaFree(d_ptr);
    }

    // Additionally, try passing a negative integer directly as an argument (will be cast)
    int *d_ptr2 = NULL;
    err = cudaMalloc((void**)&d_ptr2, -100);  // -100 will be converted to unsigned large number

    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        printf("cudaMalloc with -100 failed as expected: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
    } else {
        printf("cudaMalloc with -100 unexpectedly succeeded.\n");
        cudaFree(d_ptr2);
    }

    return 0;
