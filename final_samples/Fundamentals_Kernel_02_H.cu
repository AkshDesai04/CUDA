```cuda
/*
Print the values of `blockDim.x` and `gridDim.x` from within the kernel.

The goal is to demonstrate how to access and display the block and grid
dimensions from inside a CUDA kernel.  In CUDA, each thread can query
the builtâ€‘in variables blockDim, gridDim, blockIdx, threadIdx, etc.
Here we simply launch a single block with a single thread and let that
thread print the desired values using the device printf facility.
This keeps the output concise and illustrates the concepts without
producing a large amount of output.

Key points considered:
- Use `__global__` to define a kernel.
- Use `printf` from the device; requires compute capability >= 2.0
  and the target system must support device-side printf.
- Synchronize the host after kernel launch to ensure the prints are
  flushed before the program exits.
- Add basic error checking for the kernel launch and device sync.
- Keep the program minimal, focusing only on printing blockDim.x
  and gridDim.x.
