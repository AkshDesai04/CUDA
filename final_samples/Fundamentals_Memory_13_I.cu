/*
Call `cudaGetLastError` after a failed malloc to retrieve the error.

[My thinking] The aim of the program is to demonstrate how to call cudaGetLastError after a failed cudaMalloc in order to retrieve the error code. This is typically useful for debugging memory allocation failures. The program will attempt to allocate an extremely large amount of device memory that is unlikely to succeed, e.g. several gigabytes beyond typical device memory. After calling cudaMalloc, we check its return code. It will be cudaErrorMemoryAllocation or some other error. We then call cudaGetLastError() which clears the error but also returns the last error status. We can print this error code and its corresponding string using cudaGetErrorString. We should also call cudaGetLastError again to verify that it clears the error after retrieval. The program will not do any further device work. We'll use standard includes <stdio.h> and <cuda_runtime.h>. We'll write the code in a main() function. We'll use cudaMalloc with a huge size, maybe 1ULL << 40 bytes (1 TB). That will almost certainly fail. Then we print error. We'll handle the error string. Also note that we might need to use size_t or size_t type. We'll include error checking macro or just handle manually. We'll compile with nvcc. No external dependencies. We'll output a .cu file. That satisfies the instructions.

    cudaError_t err = cudaMalloc(&d_ptr, hugeSize);
