**Warp divergence** refers to the situation in CUDA where a *warp* (a group of 32 threads that execute in lock‑step on an NVIDIA GPU) takes different execution paths because the threads evaluate a conditional statement to different results.  
When this happens, the GPU’s hardware **serializes** the execution of the divergent branches: the entire warp executes one branch while the threads that should take the other branch are idle (masked off). After the first branch finishes, the warp executes the second branch for the remaining threads.  

In the kernel you mentioned:

```cpp
(A[i] > B[i]) ? X : Y
```

Suppose that within a given warp some threads satisfy `A[i] > B[i]` (they take the `X` branch) and others do not (they take the `Y` branch). The warp will:

1. Execute the code for branch `X` for all 32 threads, but only the threads that actually needed `X` will do useful work; the rest are masked off.  
2. Then execute the code for branch `Y` for all 32 threads, again masking the threads that should not execute `Y`.

If the two branches are of roughly equal computational cost, the warp will finish about **twice as long** as it would if all 32 threads followed the same path.  
If one branch is heavier than the other, the overall performance loss will be proportional to the relative work of the heavier branch.

The performance impact can be summarized as:

- **Reduced effective parallelism**: Only a subset of the warp does useful work at any instant.  
- **Increased latency**: The warp spends extra cycles executing both branches serially.  
- **Lower occupancy**: Because the warp is stalled while one branch executes, other warps may be forced to wait, reducing the number of warps that can be resident on the SM.

To mitigate warp divergence, programmers often restructure code to keep threads in a warp following the same control flow, use predication (compute both results and select with a mask), or employ warp‑level primitives (e.g., `__shfl_sync`) that avoid branching.
