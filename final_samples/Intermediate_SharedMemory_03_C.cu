If the `__syncthreads()` at the end of the main tile loop is omitted, the kernel will exhibit a race condition. Each thread in the block assumes that all other threads have finished processing the current tile and are ready to move on to the next one. In reality, some threads may still be reading from or writing to the shared memory buffers that hold the tile data, while others have already started fetching the next tile into the same shared memory space. This can lead to several problems:

1. **Stale or corrupted data** – A thread may read a value from shared memory that is being overwritten by another thread that has begun loading the next tile. Consequently, the computation uses incorrect or partially updated values.

2. **Incorrect results** – The dot product or other per‑tile operations will be performed on an incomplete or incorrect set of elements, producing a wrong partial sum that propagates to the final output.

3. **Unpredictable behavior** – Because the exact timing of thread execution is nondeterministic, the magnitude and pattern of the error can vary from one launch to another, making debugging difficult.

4. **Potentially hanging or crashes** – In some cases, the kernel may try to read uninitialized memory or race on synchronization points (e.g., if a thread expects data that hasn't been written yet), which can lead to segmentation faults or other runtime errors.

In short, omitting `__syncthreads()` breaks the invariant that all threads in the block have a consistent view of shared memory at the boundary of each tile. This synchronization barrier is essential to guarantee correct, deterministic computation when using shared memory for tiling.
