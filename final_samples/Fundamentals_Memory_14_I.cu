```cuda
/*
Aim of the program: Pass a `nullptr` to the kernel and have the kernel try to read or write from it. Analyze the `cuda-memcheck` report for this null pointer dereference.

Thinking:
- The kernel will accept a pointer argument that is intended to point to device memory.
- The host will deliberately pass a nullptr (0x0) instead of allocating or copying any device memory.
- Inside the kernel, we will perform a simple write operation to that pointer, e.g. *ptr = 42; This will trigger a null pointer dereference on the GPU.
- After the kernel launch, we will call cudaDeviceSynchronize() to force the kernel to finish and propagate any errors to the host.
- We then retrieve the last CUDA error with cudaGetLastError() and print it. This will usually report a generic "invalid device function" or "invalid kernel launch" if the device cannot handle the null dereference. However, the real diagnostic comes from running the program under `cuda-memcheck`. The memcheck tool will detect the invalid memory access and report a "Invalid Value (Invalid device pointer) accessed at address 0x0" or similar.
- The code includes minimal error checking for the kernel launch and device sync, and prints any returned errors. This allows a user to quickly verify that the program ran and that a CUDA error was produced.
- Note: The actual memcheck analysis must be performed externally by running: `cuda-memcheck ./program`. The output from memcheck will highlight the exact line and type of error.
- Since the kernel will write to a null pointer, the program may crash or generate an error. To avoid segmentation faults on the host side, we only pass the pointer to the kernel and never dereference it on the host. The device synchronization will catch the error.
- The program is kept intentionally simple for clarity and to focus on the null pointer dereference demonstration.
