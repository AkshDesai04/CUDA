/*
What happens if you have two bad kernel launches in a row, but only check for an error after the second one? The error from the first launch may be reported.

In this program we deliberately perform two kernel launches that are guaranteed to fail. The first launch is intentionally launched with an illegal configuration (too many threads per block) which triggers a launch failure. We do not immediately check for errors after this launch. The second launch also fails but with a different error (e.g. launching a kernel with an invalid pointer or illegal launch configuration). Only after the second launch do we query `cudaGetLastError()`. The CUDA runtime buffers errors, and the first error will be returned by `cudaGetLastError()` even though it occurred during the first launch. This demonstrates that error checking after multiple failed launches can report the earliest failure rather than the most recent one, and underscores the importance of checking for errors after each kernel launch or using synchronous error checks (e.g. `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` followed by `cudaGetLastError()`).
