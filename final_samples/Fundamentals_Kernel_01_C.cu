/*
Use `dim3` variables to define a grid of (4,1,1) and a block of (1,1,1) and launch the kernel.

In this program we create a very simple CUDA kernel that prints the block and thread indices.
The aim of the program is to demonstrate how to set up grid and block dimensions using
`dim3` variables. We define a grid with 4 blocks along the x-dimension and a block
with a single thread. After launching the kernel, we synchronize the device to ensure
that all printf output is flushed before the program exits. No memory allocations
are performed; the kernel operates purely on launch parameters. The code is fully
selfâ€‘contained and can be compiled with `nvcc` to produce an executable that
demonstrates the specified launch configuration.
