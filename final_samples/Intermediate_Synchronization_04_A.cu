An atomic operation is an indivisible, uninterruptible action that is guaranteed to execute to completion without any other concurrent process being able to observe it in an intermediate state. In other words, when a thread performs an atomic operation, the entire operation is seen as a single, instantaneous step by all other threadsâ€”no other thread can see or interfere with the operation halfway through. This property is essential in concurrent programming to prevent race conditions and ensure consistent updates to shared data.
