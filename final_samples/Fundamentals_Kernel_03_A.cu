```cuda
/*
Aim of the program: Also print the block's dimension, `blockDim.x`, alongside the thread index.

Thinking process:
- The goal is to write a minimal CUDA program that launches a kernel and has each thread print its own thread index and the dimension of its block (`blockDim.x`).
- Since we need to print from device code, we will use `printf` from device. This requires a GPU with compute capability 2.0 or higher and compiling with the appropriate architecture flag (e.g., -arch=sm_20). The code will simply call `printf` inside the kernel.
- For demonstration, I'll launch a small grid: e.g., 2 blocks each with 4 threads (so blockDim.x = 4). Each thread will output a line like "Thread idx: 3, blockDim.x: 4".
- To keep the code self‑contained, I'll include minimal error checking with a helper macro.
- The main function will:
  1. Define the grid and block dimensions.
  2. Launch the kernel.
  3. Synchronize the device to ensure all prints are flushed before the program exits.
  4. Handle any CUDA errors.
- The kernel itself will just call `printf("%d %d\n", threadIdx.x, blockDim.x);`.
- Since no host memory allocation is required, we don't need any device memory; the kernel uses only built‑in variables.

With this plan, the resulting .cu file below implements the described behavior.
