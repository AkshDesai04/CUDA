```cpp
/*
Try to create a `dim3` block variable with a size larger than the device's `maxThreadsPerBlock` limit (e.g., `dim3 block(2048)`). What happens at kernel launch?

Thinking: 
The CUDA runtime limits the number of threads that can be launched in a single block to the device property `maxThreadsPerBlock`.  
If we attempt to launch a kernel with a block configuration that exceeds this limit, the CUDA runtime will reject the kernel launch and return an error code of type `cudaErrorInvalidConfiguration`.  
To demonstrate this, the program queries the device's maximum threads per block, then intentionally sets up a `dim3` block with 2048 threads (which is larger than the typical maximum of 1024 on many GPUs).  
After launching the kernel, the program checks the returned error and prints it.  This shows that the kernel launch fails before execution begins, and the user receives a clear error message.
