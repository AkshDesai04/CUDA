It can be 1D, 2D, or 3D. \n- The *block* dimension (blockDim) determines how many threads each block contains. It also can be 1D, 2D, or 3D. \nTogether, gridDim and blockDim define the total number of threads that execute the kernel as \ngridDim.x * blockDim.x in the x‑dimension, and similarly for y and z. \nEach thread can identify its unique global index via blockIdx and threadIdx, which are computed from these dimensions. \nThis separation allows fine‑grained control of parallelism: the block size affects occupancy and memory coalescing, while the grid size determines how many blocks are distributed across the GPU’s multiprocessors. \n"""\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n__global__ void demoKernel()\n{\n    // Each thread prints its block and thread indices\n    printf("Block (%d,%d,%d), Thread (%d,%d,%d)\\n",\n           blockIdx.x, blockIdx.y, blockIdx.z,\n           threadIdx.x, threadIdx.y, threadIdx.z);\n}\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // Define grid and block dimensions\n    dim3 blockDim(4, 1, 1);   // 4 threads in x-dimension\n    dim3 gridDim(2, 1, 1);    // 2 blocks in x-dimension\n\n    // Launch the kernel\n    demoKernel<<<gridDim, blockDim>>>();\n\n    // Wait for GPU to finish before accessing on host\n    cudaDeviceSynchronize();\n\n    return 0;\n}\n', images=None, tool_calls=None)
