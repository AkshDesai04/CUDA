/*
Aim of the program:
Define the grid dimensions using a `dim3` variable: `dim3 grid_dim(4, 4);`.

My thinking:
The user request is very simple: they want a CUDA program that defines a grid dimension variable with the exact syntax shown. To make a complete, compilable CUDA source file, I will write a minimal program that includes a small kernel and launches it with the specified grid dimensions. I will also use a block dimension that is typical for demonstration purposes. The kernel will perform a trivial task (e.g., printing the block coordinates) so that the program does something observable when run. This satisfies the requirement while ensuring the code compiles and runs correctly. The program will include necessary headers, the kernel definition, the main function that sets up the grid and block dimensions, launches the kernel, and synchronizes the device before exiting. No extra comments or extraneous output will be provided outside the required comment block and the code itself.

    // Define grid dimensions as requested
    dim3 grid_dim(4, 4);
    // Define a block dimension for demonstration
    dim3 block_dim(8, 8);

    // Launch the kernel with the specified grid and block dimensions
    dummyKernel<<<grid_dim, block_dim>>>();

    // Check for launch errors
    cudaError_t err = cudaGetLastError();
    if (err != cudaSuccess)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "CUDA launch error: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
        return 1;
    }

    // Synchronize to ensure kernel completion
    err = cudaDeviceSynchronize();
    if (err != cudaSuccess)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "CUDA sync error: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
        return 1;
    }

    // Reset the device (optional)
    cudaDeviceReset();
