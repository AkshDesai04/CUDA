/*
Write a program that allocates memory on the GPU, then calls `cudaDeviceReset()`, and then attempts to use or free that memory. Observe the error that occurs.

The idea is to demonstrate that after a device reset, any previously allocated device memory becomes invalid. All handles to that memory are no longer valid, and any attempt to use or free them should produce a CUDA error. To show this, we will:

1. Allocate a small array on the GPU using cudaMalloc.
2. Launch a simple kernel that writes to this memory to confirm it works initially.
3. Call cudaDeviceReset() which destroys all allocations and resets the device state.
4. After the reset, we will:
   a. Attempt to launch the same kernel again on the same pointer. This should fail because the pointer is no longer valid.
   b. Attempt a cudaMemcpy from device to host using the stale pointer. This should also fail.
   c. Attempt to free the stale pointer with cudaFree. This should again produce an error.

For each CUDA API call, we will check the returned error code and print it, so we can see the exact error messages. The expected errors are usually `cudaErrorInvalidDevicePointer` or `cudaErrorInvalidValue`, depending on the operation.

The code below is a minimal, selfâ€‘contained CUDA C program that performs these steps and prints the results. Compile with `nvcc` and run on a machine with an active CUDA device.
