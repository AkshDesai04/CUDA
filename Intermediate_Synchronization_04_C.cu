/*
Implement increment using `atomicCAS` (Compare-And-Swap) in a loop: `int old = *addr; while (old != atomicCAS(addr, old, old+1)) { old = *addr; }`.

Thinking:
- The goal is to demonstrate a custom atomic increment operation using the low-level atomicCAS primitive.
- atomicCAS takes an address, an expected value, and a new value. It atomically compares the value at the address with the expected value; if they match, it writes the new value and returns the old value. If they don't match, it simply returns the current value at the address.
- To perform an increment safely in a concurrent environment, each thread will:
    1. Read the current value at the shared address into `old`.
    2. Call atomicCAS with `old` as the expected value and `old+1` as the new value.
    3. If the return value from atomicCAS is not equal to `old`, it means another thread modified the value after our read. In that case, we loop: read the new current value and try again.
- This loop guarantees that the increment operation is performed atomically, because each attempt to write the incremented value only succeeds if the value has not changed since we read it.
- The program will allocate a single integer on the device, initialize it to zero, launch a kernel with many threads, each thread performing one increment using the above loop. After the kernel finishes, we copy the result back to the host and verify that it equals the number of threads launched.
- The code includes basic CUDA error checking, and uses a small kernel launch configuration for simplicity.
- Note: In real code, CUDA provides atomicAdd which is more efficient. This example is purely educational to illustrate how atomicCAS can be used to build atomic operations.
