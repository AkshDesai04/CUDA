/*
Aim of the program: Explain in a comment that even if a large allocation succeeds, it might make the GPU unusable for display or other applications.

Thought process:
1. The user specifically wants a CUDA program (.cu file) with a multiline comment that contains the phrase exactly as written: "Explain in a comment that even if a large allocation succeeds, it might make the GPU unusable for display or other applications."
2. The developer instruction requires that the entire code be provided, with the comment at the top containing the aim and also the entire thinking. This means we must write the comment block with the aim phrase verbatim, then add a paragraph of reasoning and design decisions.
3. After that, the actual CUDA code should compile. The code should allocate a large block of memory on the GPU, check if the allocation succeeded, and print a warning that the GPU may become unavailable for other applications even if allocation succeeded. 
4. We will also include a small kernel that does nothing but keep the context active, to demonstrate that the memory remains allocated.
5. Finally, we will free the memory and exit.
6. No additional external files or includes beyond the standard CUDA headers are needed.

Implementation details:
- Use cudaMalloc for allocation.
- Use cudaGetLastError to catch allocation failures.
- Use cudaDeviceSynchronize after kernel launch to ensure proper execution.
- Print the size requested, whether allocation succeeded, and the warning about GPU availability.
